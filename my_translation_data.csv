A good place to hone your offroad driving skills!","","Tarn Hows to trasa popularna zarówno wśród żółtodziobów jak i doświadczonych kierowców. Wszystkim podoba się zwłaszcza szybki, nieutwardzony odcinek biegnący w dół zbocza z kilkoma występami, z których, po nabraniu odpowiedniej prędkości, można nieźle wyskoczyć. To świetne miejsce do szlifowania umiejętności jazdy terenowej!"
"5298","Race around the Horizon Festival site on this rollercoaster circuit, and you're guaranteed to thrill the crowd! Be patient on the throttle as you tackle the doughnut, and enjoy the howl of cars blasting through the neon-lit tunnels.","","Ścigając się na tym zakręconym torze w pobliżu festiwalu Horizon, na pewno rozgrzejesz publiczność do czerwoności! Ostrożnie z gazem przy pokonywaniu pętli! Naciesz uszy rozkosznym wyciem silników w oświetlonych neonami tunelach."
"5299","This scramble around Mortimer Gardens mainly sticks to the dirt paths, but it still has a few surprises to keep you on your toes, including a monument that you'll have to dodge, some water splashes, and a narrow tunnel to squeeze through.","","Ten cross po Ogrodach Mortimera prowadzi głównie przez nieutwardzone drogi, lecz ma w zanadrzu parę niespodzianek, które z pewnością podniosą ciśnienie kierowcom: pomnik do ominięcia, wodę na trasie oraz wąski tunel, przez który trzeba się przecisnąć."
"5300","A highly technical circuit around the narrow streets of Ambleside village. Despite its small size, the circuit packs in lots of hills and corners, many of which are tight and blind, with rough kerbs to unsettle your car. You'll need quick reflexes to succeed here!","","Wśród wąskich uliczek wioski Ambleside wytyczono niesamowicie techniczny tor. Mimo jego niewielkich rozmiarów, znajduje się tu sporo wzniesień i ciasnych zakrętów z ograniczoną widocznością. Gdy dołożymy do tego bezlitosne dla podwozia krawężniki, otrzymamy trasę wymagającą błyskawicznego refleksu."
"5301","A twisty scramble circuit on the outskirts of Ambleside, which is wholly on dirt. This route never fails to delight all year round, and is especially popular with drivers that like quick acceleration, steep elevation changes, and power-sliding around corners.","","Pokręcony tor crossowy na obrzeżach Ambleside składa się w całości z nieutwardzonych dróg. Kierowcy ścigają się na niej przez okrągły rok, zwłaszcza ci, którzy cenią sobie gwałtowne przyspieszenie, nagłe zmiany wysokości i pokonywanie zakrętów w kontrolowanym poślizgu."
"5302","A compact circuit that is easy to learn, hard to master. Many of Horizon's top drivers cut their teeth here, and always come back for more. As you acclimate to faster and faster cars, you'll find new appreciation for how tricky it is to nail the first and penultimate corners.","","Ten kompaktowy tor jest łatwy do przejechania, ale trudny to całkowitego opanowania. Najbardziej wytrawni kierowcy w Horizon zjedli na nim zęby, lecz zawsze wracają po więcej. Odwiedzając tę trasę w coraz to szybszych autach, zaczyna się darzyć szacunkiem pierwszy i ostatni zakręt."
"5303","A challenging circuit with some important corners to master. After the first chicane you'll be faced with an uphill, right-hand hairpin, which can make or break your lap, followed by a kink in the back straight requiring a precise line. A good exit from the final corner is crucial!","","Wymagający tor z kilkoma zakrętami, których lepiej nie lekceważyć. Już po pierwszej z szykan trzeba zmierzyć się z prowadzącym pod górę nawrotem w prawo, od którego nierzadko zależy powodzenie całego okrążenia. Potem mamy prostą z niewielkim odchyleniem, wymagającym bezbłędnej precyzji. Idealne wyjście z ostatniego zakrętu wieńczy dzieło!"
"5304","Although this track mostly has a sealed surface, you'd be unwise to underestimate it. The dirt section is technical, uphill, and fords a river, so you'll need something with good off-road capability to win here in the shadows of Glen Rannoch.","","Choć ta trasa składa się głównie z gładkich dróg, nie wolno traktować jej z przymrużeniem oka. Część nieutwardzona jest bardzo techniczna, prowadzi pod górę, a nawet przez bród rzeczny, z czego wynika, że nie warto zapuszczać się w cień góry Glen Rannoch bez porządnego, terenowego pojazdu."
"5305","An unexpectedly tough circuit. You'll be threading your way around Holyrood Park along narrow roads flanked with walls on one side, and cliffs on the other. Stay focussed and be brave with the throttle to maximise your speed at this track.","","Tor o niespodziewanie wysokim poziomie trudności. Na prowadzących wokół parku Holyrood wąskich drogach biegnących pomiędzy murem a stromym klifem będziesz walczyć o każdy metr szosy. Nie trać koncentracji i nie bój się dociskać pedału gazu, aby nabrać prędkości tam, gdzie ta szalona trasa ci na to pozwoli."
"5306","Careful as you layer on the throttle to power out of the long right-handed crescent, then thread your way through the technical chicane for a good last-corner exit onto the home straight. Get it right and you'll pass the castle at top speed! Good luck.","","Na wyjściu z długiego łuku w prawo dodawaj gazu z rozwagą, a potem pokonaj techniczną szykanę tak, aby bezbłędnie wyjść z końcowego zakrętu na ostatnią prostą. Jeśli dobrze zgrasz wszystkie te elementy, miniesz zamek z najwyższą prędkością! Powodzenia."
"5307","A high-speed loop situated on the side of a steep hill in the moors. You'll need to be careful braking downhill into the first turn, before climbing back towards the wind turbines. Thanks to its exposed location, this track is especially treacherous in adverse weather conditions.","","Szybka pętla wytyczona na stromym zboczu torfowiska. Ostrożnie hamuj na zjeździe w kierunku pierwszego zakrętu, a następnie wespnij się z powrotem w pobliże turbin wiatrowych. Ze względu na swój odsłonięty charakter, ta trasa jest szczególnie zdradziecka w nieprzychylnych warunkach pogodowych."
"5308","An undulating dirt circuit that weaves both under and over the M68 motorway. The fast flowing turns are punctuated with bumps and jumps that can catch you out, and you'll need to be careful not to run wide on the corner exits.","","Nierówna i nieutwardzona trasa przechodząca nad i pod autostradą M68. Szybkie serie zakrętów najeżone są wybojami i hopami, na których trzeba mieć się na baczności. Tylko nie wychodź za szeroko z zakrętów!"
"5309","If only those standing stones could tell you their stories… You can feel the age of this place if you take a moment to soak it in. Maybe after you've finished lapping around this circuit at breakneck speed you could stop for a photo.","","Gdyby tylko te stojące kamienie potrafiły mówić… Powietrze przesączone jest pradawną atmosferą tego miejsca, którą aż chce się rozkoszować. Tylko kiedy znaleźć na to czas? Może gdy już skończysz pędzić po tym torze na złamanie karku, znajdziesz moment na cyknięcie sobie zdjęcia."
"5310","Mudkickers' Adventure Park is specially designed to give even the most extreme offroad vehicles an intense workout. This brutal scramble circuit features huge jumps, deep pools of standing water and slippery, muddy tracks. Make sure you equip off-road tires and suspension!","","Park rozrywki Mudkickers stworzono tak, aby dać w kość nawet najbardziej ekstremalnym pojazdom terenowym. Ten brutalny tor crossowy zawiera imponujące hopy, głębokie zlewiska oraz śliskie od błota odcinki. Bez opon i zawieszenia terenowego ani rusz!"
"5311","This route is one of Alex's favorites, with short straights divided by sharp turns that climb the hill through the forest, followed by a downhill helter-skelter on dirt. You can pick up some serious speed before power-sliding around that hairpin!","","To jedna z ulubionych tras Alexa, gdzie krótkie proste oddzielone są od siebie ostrymi zakrętami, które prowadzą kierowcę na szczyt zalesionego wzgórza. Następnie czeka nas nieutwardzona ''zjeżdżalnia''. Przed wejściem w poślizgu w nawrót można nabrać konkretnej prędkości!"
"5312","This scramble circuit has a long and fast home straight with sharp corners at either end, and a technical section on dirt in the middle. Lightweight rally cars that can stop, turn, and fire themselves around the corners will do well here.","","Ten tor crossowy składa się z pięknej i długiej prostej z ostrymi zakrętami na początku i na końcu oraz technicznego, nieutwardzonego odcinka pośrodku. Doskonale poradzą sobie tutaj lekkie rajdówki, zdolne do błyskawicznego hamowania, skrętów i przyspieszania."
"5313","A demanding circuit of two halves. The home straight is located on the high street, which is nice and wide, giving the village its name. After that, you'll dive down the back lanes, which are narrow, twisty, and lined with trees. Make full use of the track width!","","Ten wymagający tor składa się z dwóch połówek. Prosta startowa znajduje się na szerokiej, głównej ulicy, której wieś zawdzięcza swoją nazwę. Potem trasa wiedzie nas w boczne uliczki – wąskie, pokręcone i otoczone drzewami. Dobrze wykorzystaj całą szerokość trasy!"
"5314","The famous Princes Street Gardens encircle Edinburgh Castle, and this circuit traces the gardens' outline, giving you impressive views of the castle from all sides as you lap around it. As you might expect from a place never designed for cars, the roads are quite narrow and twisty.","","Słynny park Princes Street Gardens otacza zamek w Edynburgu, a ten tor wytyczono zaraz przy jego brzegu, aby uwydatnić walory zamku z każdej jego strony. Tego miejsca nie projektowano z myślą o samochodach, więc spodziewaj się wielu wąskich i krętych miejsc."
"5315","You'll be racing around the second busiest railway station in Scotland, after Glasgow Central. Put on a show to cheer up the commuters, and check out all the landmarks as you whizz past, including the Scottish National Gallery and the Scott Monument.","","Czeka cię przebieżka wokół drugiej najbardziej zatłoczonej stacji kolejowej w całej Szkocji, zaraz po Glasgow Central. Popraw humor podróżnym swoimi popisami i naciesz oczy edynburskimi atrakcjami, takimi jak Scottish National Gallery czy pomnik Scotta."
"5316","People love to see their favorite cars tearing up the streets of Edinburgh! This whistle-stop tour zips through the city center and outskirts alike, with a range of technical and high-speed turns. Don't worry, this is a sanctioned event and you'll be racing on closed roads!","","Kogóż nie zachwycą piękne auta szalejące po ulicach Edynburga? Wycieczka objazdowa prowadzi przez centrum oraz obrzeża miasta, oferując całą gamę technicznych zakrętów oraz szybkich łuków. Bez obaw, wszystko odbędzie się na legalu i na zamkniętych drogach!"
"5317","An asphalt route with a twist at the halfway point, where you cross the spillway atop Derwent Dam. A lightweight sportscar might be slowed down by the water, but should be able to make up for it on the rest of the route, so make your choice carefully!","","Asfaltowa trasa z niezwykłą atrakcją w połowie – przelewem na szczycie tamy Derwent. Lekki samochód sportowy może i zwolni na wodzie, lecz powinien nadrobić tę stratę na pozostałych częściach trasy, więc warto dobrze zastanowić się nad wyborem wozu!"
"5318","A long and complex route that threads its way through Lakehurst Forest, before rounding back on itself in the southern lowlands of Glen Rannoch. The route then follows the edge of Derwentwater as it heads south, treating you to breath-taking panoramic views before the finish line.","","Ta długa i niełatwa trasa wiedzie przez las Lakehurst i południowe niziny Glen Rannoch. Potem droga prowadzi brzegiem jeziora Derwent prosto na południe, dając okazję do nacieszenia się zapierającym dech w piersiach widokiem przed dotarciem do linii mety."
"5319","This route sticks to the roads and follows the contours around the northern half of Derwentwater, passing the Roman ruins at Mortimer Gardens before leapfrogging humpback bridges and sprinting towards the finish-line close to Whitewater Falls.","","Ta trasa prowadzi przez szosy wiodące wzdłuż obrzeża północnej części jeziora Derwent. Mijając rzymskie ruiny w Ogrodach Mortimera, doprowadza kierowców aż do łukowatych mostów i szaleńczego sprintu do mety w pobliżu Wodospadów Whitewater."
"5320","Sprint from Lakehurst Forest along the east bank of Derwentwater towards Ambleside. With lots of fast, flowing turns, you can't go wrong with all-out power on this route, although the narrow village streets can catch out unwary drivers.","","Sprint na trasie prowadzącej z lasu Lakehurst wzdłuż wschodniego brzegu jeziora Derwent w kierunku Ambleside. Na tej trasie składającej się z szybkich, łukowatych zakrętów warto postawić na jak najwyższą moc, choć wąskie wiejskie uliczki mogą zaskoczyć nieuważnych kierowców."
"5321","A lengthy route heading out of the Cotswolds via Ashbrook before wrapping around Derwent Reservoir and finishing at the waterside. A mixture of undulating roads with fast and slow turns will test all aspects of your driving and your vehicle.","","Ta długa trasa wyrusza z Cotswolds, prowadzi przez Ashbrook i znajduje swój koniec w pobliżu zalewu Derwent, przy samej wodzie. Wybuchowa mieszanka nierównych dróg oraz szybkich i wolnych zakrętów będzie doskonałym sprawdzianem zarówno dla twojego wozu, jak i umiejętności."
"5322","An epic all-asphalt route departing from central Edinburgh before taking the southbound motorway where you can pick up some serious speed. Just don't miss your exit!","","Pełna rozmachu trasa prowadząca wyłącznie po asfaltowych drogach z samego centrum Edynburga na autostradę wiodącą na południe, gdzie można rozwinąć niebagatelną prędkość. Tylko nie pomyl zjazdu!"
"5323","This route takes its name from the area of Edinburgh that welcomes you at the finish line. First you'll have to battle your way along the coast before routing around the Aerodrome. Races are won or lost at the sharp turn after you cross the end of the runway.","","Nazwa tej trasy pochodzi od dzielnicy Edynburga, w której znajduje się meta. Zanim jednak tam dotrzesz, musisz przedostać się przez wybrzeże i pokręcić się po lotnisku. O zwycięstwie lub porażce zadecyduje ostry zakręt zaraz za końcem pasa startowego."
"5324","Start at Otleydale and pass the historic standing stones before roaring across the Astmoor hilltops. The last stretch is an ultra high-speed downhill sprint towards Elmsdon-on-Sea, which welcomes you with incredible sea views all year round. Enjoy!","","Trasa zaczyna się spokojnie w Otleydale, na drodze wiodącej wzdłuż stojących kamieni, by niebawem zmienić się w zabójczo szybki przejazd po wzgórzach Astmoor. Ostatni odcinek to szaleńczy sprint w kierunku Elmsdon-on-Sea, miejsca zachwycającego morskimi krajobrazami przez cały rok. Miłej zabawy!"
"5325","Set off from the Rail Yard with a series of straights and square corners until you reach the shadows of Glen Rannoch. From there, climb your way up and over the mountain along a narrow pass, finishing in the valley on the far side.","","Pierwsza stacja to dworzec kolejowy, gdzie pokonasz całą serię prostych i zakrętów pod kątem prostym, aby dojechać bez przesiadki pod cień góry Glen Rannoch. Stamtąd pojedziesz przez grzbiet góry i przełęcz, by na drugim jej końcu dotrzeć do ostatniej stacji w dolinie."
"5326","A brutal sprint along some of Britain's toughest country roads! You'll fly past Mortimer Gardens, then criss-cross the river and follow the foothills of Glen Rannoch towards the Rail Yard. This one is all about grip and cornering at speed!","","Brutalny sprint przez najtrudniejsze wiejskie drogi w całej Wielkiej Brytanii! Najpierw przemkniesz przez Ogrody Mortimera, potem przetniesz rzekę i trasą u podnóży Glen Rannoch trafisz na dworzec kolejowy. Tu chodzi przede wszystkim o przyczepność i pokonywanie zakrętów przy wysokiej prędkości!"
"5327","Not only does this scramble circuit offer mixed-surface racing, but it also features a blend of high and low-speed corners, dips, jumps, and camber. You'll flourish here if you have a well-rounded skillset, but try not to be distracted by the picturesque scenery.","","Ten cross składa się z dróg o różnych rodzajach nawierzchni i stanowi wybuchową mieszankę szybkich i wolnych zakrętów, spadków, hop i nachyleń. To prawdziwy raj dla wszechstronnego kierowcy, jeśli tylko uda mu się oderwać wzrok od zachwycających widoków."
"5328","A long and difficult dirt race, popular with rally fans. The route skirts along the west bank of Derwentwater, featuring many twists, turns, and seasonal water splashes. Finally the route encircles Mortimer Gardens, finishing at the foothills to the north.","","Długi i niełatwy wyścig crossowy, popularny wśród fanów rajdów. Trasa przebiega wzdłuż zachodniego wybrzeża jeziora Derwent i obfituje w skręty, łuki i sezonowe rozlewiska. Pod koniec trasa otacza Ogrody Mortimera i znajduje swój koniec na północnym pogórzu."
"5329","Set off from the Horizon Festival, sticking to the asphalt while you dip into Lakehurst Forest, then turn onto winding gravel roads that head downhill towards the Uffington White Horse. The final sprint returns to the blacktop, and finishes at Ashbrook.","","Wyrusz z festiwalu Horizon i trzymaj się asfaltu, który zaprowadzi cię do lasu Lakehurst. Następnie wjedź na kręte, żwirowe drogi, które zaprowadzą cię do Białego Konia z Uffington. Przy ostatnim sprincie drogi znów zrobią się czarne, aż do samej mety w Ashbrook."
"5330","One of Horizon's most technical rally routes. You'll have to snake your way up Glen Rannoch's dirt trails over a series of switchbacks known as Shepherd's Crook, then watch your weight transfer as you do the same thing down the other side of the mountain.","","To jedna z najbardziej technicznych tras rajdowych w całym Horizon. Najpierw wespnij się na górę Glen Rannoch po nieutwardzonych serpentynach znanych jako Kij Pasterza, a następnie przesuń środek ciężkości, zjeżdżając w dół po przeciwnej stronie szczytu."
"5331","This mixed-surface trail race begins at Holyrood Park, before leaving the asphalt for a scramble up towards Arthur's Seat, and then re-joining the roads on the far side of the park. Finally, you'll wrap around the access roads at Greendale Aerodrome for a last dash to the finish.","","Ten wyścig terenowy po różnych rodzajach nawierzchni ma swój początek w parku Holyrood, za którym jego trasa opuszcza asfalt, aby wspiąć się na wzgórze Arthur's Seat i dołączyć do dróg po drugiej stronie parku. Ostatecznie dostaniesz się na drogi dojazdowe do lotniska Greendale i popędzisz w stronę mety."
"5332","Set off from Bamburgh, climbing the hill inland on asphalt before detouring around the highland farms, then continue on to Mudkickers' Adventure Park for some serious off-road action through deep water and big jumps. That'll put your car through its paces!","","Wyruszysz z Bamburgh, asfaltową drogą pod górkę, po czym napotkasz kilka objazdów wśród górskich farm. W parku rozrywki Mudkickers zażyjesz porządnej terenowej jazdy przez głęboką wodę i wysokie hopy. Niezła ścieżka zdrowia dla twojego auta!"
"5333","This long route winds its way up a dirt track from Bamburgh to Astmoor, before switching to asphalt and heading north. Another long dirt section follows the motorway downhill towards Greendale Aerodrome. Will you prioritise speed, cornering, or a good all-rounder?","","Ta długa trasa prowadzi przez krętą, nieutwardzoną drogę z Bamburgh do Astmoor, a po zmianie na asfalt kieruje się na północ. Kolejny długi, nieutwardzony odcinek wiedzie w dół, wzdłuż autostrady do lotniska Greendale. Na jakie auto postawisz: szybkie czy zwrotne? A może spróbujesz pogodzić ogień z wodą?"
"5334","A purist rally trail, starting by the coast but quickly climbing into the moors before snaking its way back inland. The hairpins demand great driving skill when it comes to weight transfer, throttle, and braking.","","Szlak rajdowy w czystej postaci. Rozpoczyna się przy wybrzeżu, lecz prędko ucieka na torfowiska, tylko po to, aby niepostrzeżenie powrócić w głąb lądu. Liczne nawroty przetestują twoje umiejętności w dziedzinach przenoszenia środka ciężkości, przyspieszenia i hamowania."
"5335","Battle against the current as you cross the water at Derwent Dam, before following the roads north towards the Rail Yard. Cars better suited to asphalt may pull ahead in the middle section of the race, but the final leg is on dirt, giving off-roaders a chance to pounce at the end.","","Zmierz się z prądem wodnym, pokonując rozlewisko przy tamie Derwent, po czym udaj się szosą na północ w kierunku dworca kolejowego. Środkowy odcinek da zabłysnąć autom przystosowanym do asfaltu, ale ostatnia część trasy to już nieutwardzona nawierzchnia, co da szansę samochodom terenowym na szybkie nadrobienie strat przed samą metą."
"5336","One of our shorter trails, but it's almost wholly on dirt. First you'll be climbing a steep hill out of Lakehurst Forest along a series of looping hairpins and tight switchbacks, before the route opens out for a high-speed flyby of The Great Ridge.","","To jedna z naszych krótszych tras, lecz wytyczyliśmy ją prawie całkowicie na nieutwardzonej nawierzchni. Najpierw czeka cię wspinaczka na strome wzgórze w pobliżu lasu Lakehurst, w rytmie wytyczonym przez nawroty i wąskie wiraże. Następnie pomkniesz szybkim odcinkiem przy Great Ridge."
"5337","The Uffington White Horse is one of Britain's most recognisable and ancient landmarks, made from trenches filled with chalk. It's been there for about 3,000 years, and this route passes right by it as you race from Derwent Reservoir to Lakehurst Forest.","","Biały Koń z Uffington to jeden z najbardziej charakterystycznych i najstarszych zabytków w Wielkiej Brytanii. Wykonano go około 3000 lat temu, wykopując rowy odsłaniające wapienne podłoże. Ta trasa z zalewu Derwent do lasu Lakehurst pozwoli ci go zobaczyć."
"5338","I reckon this is one of my best routes yet! These roads are pretty remote so there aren't many people around, and racing through the valley under the viaduct is such an amazing spectacle! The road follows the river, so don't run wide on those left turns.","","To jedna z moich najbardziej udanych tras! Okolica jest dość wyludniona, a szkoda, bo wyścig przez dolinę i pod wiaduktem robi niesamowite wrażenie! Droga przebiega wzdłuż rzeki, więc pamiętaj, by nie pokonywać zakrętów w lewo zbyt szeroko."
"5339","Starting down by the lake at Ambleside, you'll begin a scenic hillclimb from the village, passing the famous Bridge House along the way. The climb becomes much steeper towards the end, as you tackle the switchbacks leading towards Lakehurst forest.","","Wycieczka rozpoczyna się przy jeziorze w pobliżu Ambleside. Następnie wieś i wspinaczka po pagórkach. Proszę spojrzeć, za oknem słynny dom przy moście. Na końcu proszę się czegoś złapać, bo czekają nas strome serpentyny wiodące aż do celu naszej podróży – lasu Lakehurst."
"5340","This route packs a lot of corners into a small area! If you drift around Horseshoe Turn while you're racing, it'll be good practice for the Drift Zone there too!","","Ta trasa ma zdecydowanie największe zagęszczenie zakrętów na kilometr kwadratowy! Jeśli zdecydujesz się wejść w podkowę bokiem, poćwiczysz przy okazji umiejętności przydatne w pobliskiej strefie driftu!"
"5341","Alex and I have found a brilliant road through the mountains at Glen Rannoch, you've gotta see it! I'll send a few texts and we should have everything set up for a race tonight. See you there, yeah?","","Udało mi się znaleźć z Alexem świetną drogę przez góry przy Glen Rannoch. Musisz to zobaczyć! Kilka SMS-ów i ugadamy wszystko, żeby móc się tam wieczorem pościgać. To co, do zobaczenia na miejscu?"
"5342","Here's a great little route for you, making use of the access roads around Greendale Aerodrome before heading down to the coast. I've thrown in some tricky hairpins for good measure, but I reckon you can handle it.","","Doskonała, kameralna trasa, w sam raz dla ciebie. Zaczyna się na drogach dojazdowych do lotniska Greendale, po czym wiedzie w stronę wybrzeża. Udało mi się dorzucić kilka wymagających nawrotów po drodze, ale co to dla ciebie."
"5343","I originally planned to stick to the city outskirts, but then I saw how cool the castle looked at night, and decided it would be a shame not to detour past it. And then you can blast over the station before heading out the other side of town. It's gonna be so much fun!","","Z założenia miała to być trasa na obrzeżach miasta, lecz zamek wygląda nocą tak świetnie, że trzeba było zdecydować się na mały objazd. Potem szybka przebieżka przez stację i lądujesz po drugiej stronie miasta. Ale będzie fajnie!"
"5344","Bring your fastest and flashiest car to this one! We'll blast through the city centre before turning on to the bypass where you can really open up the throttle, then head back towards Edinburgh for a full-speed finish!","","Na tę trasę wyciągnij z garażu swój najszybszy i najbardziej efektowny wóz! Śmigniemy przez centrum miasta, a potem na obwodnicę, gdzie będzie można wcisnąć gaz do dechy. Na koniec powrót do Edynburga, aby z pełną prędkością zameldować się na mecie!"
"5345","When Alex suggested this route, nobody knew what a 'wynd' was, and he didn't explain. Anyway, the route takes you through the back streets of central Edinburgh before finishing in the suburbs. Should be pretty epic!","","Gdy Alex zaproponował tę trasę, nikt nie wiedział co ze szkockiego znaczy ''wynd''. Alex do dzisiaj nam tego nie zdradził. Nieistotne. Ważne jest to, że na tej trasie zwiedzisz boczne uliczki w centrum Edynburga, a następnie przedrzesz się do przedmieścia. Będzie epicko!"
"5346","Okay so Keira hasn't signed off on this route yet, but we'll run it at night-time when it's quiet and everything will be fine, right? Right?!","","Wiesz, Keira nie dała nam jeszcze zielonego światła na tę trasę, ale śmigniemy tam sobie po cichu w nocy i wszystko będzie cacy, prawda? Prawda?!"
"5347","This route nips through the back streets of Edinburgh then heads out of town along one of Jay's favourite roads to drive down, past Kirk Loch. It's pretty narrow and twisty there, so you'll want something light and agile to get through at full speed.","","Ta trasa prowadzi przez boczne uliczki Edynburga i wyjeżdża z miasta po jednej z ulubionych dróg Jaya, koło Kirk Loch. Jest na niej kręto i ciasno, więc jeśli chcesz uzyskać dobry czas, to użyj lekkiego i zwinnego auta."
"5348","Long, sweeping fast turns are the order of the day for this challenging street race. If you're lucky, you might see dawn break over the horizon as you hurtle towards Elmsdon-on-Sea, but there's no time to stop and admire the view while racing at 150 mph.","","Na dziś mamy przewidziane długie i szybkie zakręty w ramach wymagającego wyścigu ulicznego. Jeśli uśmiechnie się do ciebie szczęście, może uda ci się zobaczyć świt na szybkim przejeździe do Elmsdon-on-Sea, lecz pędząc 150 mph nie będzie ci łatwo się zatrzymać, żeby dłużej nacieszyć nim oczy."
"5349","These roads through the moors are nice and quiet during the night, perfect for a spot of street racing! We'll set off from the Adventure Park, then head over to Astmoor, loop around the Standing Stones at Otleydale, then down towards Elmsdon-on-Sea. Should be good fun!","","W nocy drogi biegnące przez torfowiska są ciche i spokojne, więc czemu nie zrobić tu wyścigu ulicznego? Zaczniemy w parku rozrywki, potem skierujemy się do Astmoor, pokręcimy w się przy stojących kamieniach w Otleydale, a następnie pojedziemy w stronę Elmsdon-on-Sea. Będzie grubo!"
"5350","If you set off from Moorhead Wind Farm and stick to the B-roads, you can be at the finish line before anybody notices. You know, just a low-key event. Keira doesn't need to know. She's super busy with festival stuff anyway, so we're kinda doing her a favor by not telling her.","","Jeśli wyruszysz z farmy wiatrowej Moorhead i będziesz trzymać się z dala od głównych dróg, trafisz na metę, zanim ktokolwiek się spostrzeże. Wiesz, takie małe, ciche zawody. Keira nie musi o tym wiedzieć. I tak ma pełno roboty z festiwalem, więc właściwie to robimy jej przysługę, siedząc cicho."
"5351","This cheeky little route heads down the Derwent Reservoir, crosses the river at Oldweir, then heads over to Mudkickers' Adventure Park. Don't hang around in the woods though, that place gives me the creeps when it's dark!","","Ta droga jest jak mały niesforny chochlik. Startujesz przy zalewie Derwent, przecinasz rzekę koło Oldweir, a potem jedziesz do parku rozrywki Mudkickers. Tylko nie kręć się po lesie nocą, ciarki mi po plecach przechodzą, gdy jest tam tak ciemno!"
"5352","I found a great little driving road along the edge of Derwentwater that heads all the way to Ambleside. It's pretty high speed the whole way, so bring something sporty with plenty of downforce!","","Znalazłem doskonałą dróżkę przy brzegu jeziora Derwent, która wiedzie prosto do Ambleside. Można po niej nieźle poginać, więc staw się na starcie w czymś sportowym o sporej sile docisku!"
"5353","This street race winds its way through the forest until it reaches Derwent Reservoir. After that, you'll be following the river north as it snakes towards the lake district for a dramatic photo-finish.","","Ten wyścig uliczny pozwoli ci pobłąkać się po lesie i zapuścić się w okolice zalewu Derwent. Potem trasa powiedzie cię wzdłuż rzeki na północ, zakosami w stronę pojezierza, a o zwycięstwie zadecydują zapewne ułamki sekund."
"5354","Batham Gate is the medieval name of a Roman road, which lends its name to this route. Once you've passed Ashbrook you can open up the throttle as you weave through the forests towards the Horizon Festival where the crowd will be cheering you on!","","Brama Batham to średniowieczna nazwa rzymskiej drogi, od której pochodzi nazwa tej trasy. Za Ashbrook możesz wcisnąć gaz do dechy, pędząc przez las w stronę festiwalu Horizon, gdzie niewątpliwie będzie czekać na ciebie tłum fanów!"
"5355","This twisty street race takes you all around the narrow back streets of Broadway village. With multiple crossing points you'll need to keep an eye out for any stragglers and traffic along the way! You'll need all of your skill, and maybe a little luck, to succeed here.","","Ten kręty wyścig uliczny poprowadzi cię po wąskich zaułkach wioski Broadway. Będzie tam sporo skrzyżowań, więc miej oko na maruderów oraz innych uczestników ruchu! Aby dać sobie rady, będziesz potrzebować wszystkich swoich umiejętności oraz odrobiny szczęścia."
"5356","A tricky route, especially in the dark, which wraps around Derwent Reservoir before heading uphill towards the Horizon Festival Site through dense woodland, and then cresting the hill to a breath-taking vista at the finish line. You'll want plenty of downforce for those high-speed turns.","","To niełatwa trasa, szczególnie po ciemku. Okrąża zalew Derwent, a potem prowadzi w górę przez gęsty las w kierunku festiwalu Horizon, a następnie wiedzie po szczycie pagórka. Meta znajduje się w naprawdę zachwycającym miejscu, uwierz mi. Aby poradzić sobie z szybkimi zakrętami, przyda ci się spora siła docisku."
"5357","Are you ready to run the Gauntlet? This is Horizon's toughest mixed-surface route, only for the bravest of off-road racers. Start by the coast and head west until you reach the Slate Quarry, then head north and loop around the top of Derwentwater on this 15.7 mile trail race.","","Czy podejmiesz wyzwanie? To najtrudniejszy wyścig na różnorakich nawierzchniach w całym Horizon, tylko dla najodważniejszych amatorów jazdy terenowej. Z wybrzeża udajesz się na zachód, aż do kamieniołomów, potem kierujesz się na północ i okrążasz część jeziora Derwent. Po 15,7 mili meldujesz się na mecie tego wyścigu terenowego."
"5358","Tumble through the woodland at Elmsdon-on-Sea before splash-landing in the water. Then head up the coast towards Bamburgh, where you'll leap through the dunes. Bring something with good ground-clearance and traction on sand!","","Najpierw przedzierasz się przez lasy w Elmsdon-on-Sea, potem lądujesz z rozpryskiem w wodzie. Następnie pędzisz wzdłuż wybrzeża do Bamburgh i przeskakujesz po wydmach. Wybierz wóz z wysokim prześwitem i dobrą przyczepnością na piasku!"
"5359","A great way to see Bamburgh Castle! Leap from the dunes into the West Ward, then race through the castle grounds and back out the other side. Just make sure your car is fast and light enough to make that jump! You'll have to go around on the beach if not.","","Chcesz zwiedzić zamek Bamburgh? Świetnie! Zeskocz z wydm na zachodni dziedziniec, a następnie pomknij przez całą posiadłość i wyjedź po jej drugiej stronie. Warto zadbać o szybki i lekki wóz, który da radę przeskoczyć tam, gdzie trzeba! W przeciwnym razie czeka cię objazd przez plażę."
"5360","A route that thunders down the mountainside into Glen Rannoch, crossing the river back and forth as it winds its way beneath Glenfinnan Viaduct. Finally, scramble up the slopes of the valley before taking a huge running jump into the wetlands where the finish line awaits!","","Trasa biegnąca w dół zbocza góry Glen Rannoch, wielokrotnie przecinająca rzekę oraz wiodąca pod wiaduktem Glenfinnan. Pod koniec czeka cię wspinaczka po zboczach doliny, gdzie nabierzesz rozpędu, by wskoczyć na mokradła, skąd już blisko do linii mety."
"5361","Barrel down the hillside towards Ambleside village, plunging through the river and narrow back-streets before bounding back across the fields towards where you started. A heavy vehicle will help you gather momentum and capitalise on that initial downhill run.","","Stocz się po wzgórzu w kierunku wioski Ambleside, przez rzekę i ciasne uliczki, po czym wróć przez pola do punktu startowego. Ciężki pojazd najlepiej wykorzysta początkowy odcinek wiodący w dół zbocza i zachowa najwięcej pędu."
"5362","If you think you've got what it takes to be a sprint racing champion, then this is the route for you! This epic point-to-point race takes you from Broadway all the way to Edinburgh, calling at Derwent Reservoir and Greendale Aerodrome along the way. Good luck!","","Jeśli sądzisz, że nadajesz się na mistrza sprintu, ta trasa jest dla ciebie!

Just try not to break any ancient Roman ruins please.","","Ogrody Mortimera mają chyba wszystko, czego potrzeba do szczęścia. Trawniki, zbiorniki wodne, drogi utwardzone i nieutwardzone, drzewa oraz parking. Idealne miejsce na rajd przełajowy! Tylko postaraj się nie zdewastować żadnych rzymskich ruin."
"5365","Roar across the mountaintops of Glen Rannoch before crashing through the Rail Yard at full speed! You'll catch some serious air as you come down the mountain, so make sure you're driving something with good suspension travel and off-road capability.","","Pędź po szczytach Glen Rannoch i przedrzyj się z pełną prędkością przez dworzec kolejowy! Zjeżdżając z góry będzie można oderwać się na chwilę od ziemi, więc zadbaj o maszynę z dobrym zawieszeniem, która poradzi sobie w terenie."

Oh, and look out for the sheep!","","Przedrzyj się przez rzekę i otwarte pola, po czym przejedź przez Ambleside i rozbij niemałą liczbę kamiennych murków, pokonując nachylone zakręty na drodze do jeziora Derwent. Aha, i uważaj na owce!"
"5367","A very technical circuit within the Railyard, and although the surface is mostly paved, you'll want suspension travel that can handle big jumps, and clatter over exposed rails and sleepers as you weave between derelict train wagons and shipping containers.","","Techniczny tor wyznaczony w całości w obrębie dworca kolejowego. Wprawdzie nawierzchnia jest w większości utwardzona, lecz przyda ci się zawieszenie, które poradzi sobie z dużymi hopami i nie podda się podczas jazdy po torach i podkładach, gdy będziesz przemykać się wśród porzuconych wagonów i kontenerów."
"5368","Nobody knows how Jay managed to convince Keira to approve a circuit that included one of his most extreme Danger Signs as part of the race route, but here it is. Enjoy the view and hold on to your hat!","","Nie mam pojęcia, w jaki sposób Jay przekonał Keirę, by zatwierdziła tor zawierający jeden z najniebezpieczniejszych znaków ostrzegawczych. Ważne, że mu się udało. Ciesz się widokiem i trzymaj się kierownicy!"

Or are you brave enough to jump on top of them? Oh, and look out for sneaky alternative paths!","","Ten tor w kształcie ósemki to emocjonująca gratka dla kierowców i kibiców! Czy zmieścisz się w wąskim tunelu z kontenerami nad tobą i po obu stronach trasy? A może strzeli ci do głowy, żeby na nie wskoczyć? Wypatruj ukrytych dróg alternatywnych!"
"5370","Romp across Edinburgh's city parks, avoiding the trees and tourists alike, before crossing the railway at the end of the lap. Make sure you bring something with enough ground clearance to tackle the ramps along this Cross Country circuit.","","Porozbijaj się po parkach miejskich Edynburga, unikając drzew i turystów, aż dotrzesz do toru kolejowego na końcu okrążenia. Zorganizuj sobie coś z odpowiednim prześwitem, by poradzić sobie z rampami na trasie tego rajdu przełajowego."
"5371","Start inland and go for a Cross Country run towards the sea! This route bounds across Queensforth Golf Course, snakes across the runway at Greendale Aerodrome, then crashes down the hillside to arrive at the lighthouse north of Bamburgh.","","Ten rajd przełajowy zabierze cię na wycieczkę z głębi lądu nad morze! Przetniesz pole golfowe w Queensforth, pokręcisz się po pasie startowym lotniska Greendale, po czym zjedziesz w dół pagórka do latarni morskiej na północ od Bamburgh."
"5372","Rush across open fields towards Edinburgh, and try not to catch a radiator full of stone-wall as you go. It's a steady descent from the windfarm, so long as you don't get bogged down in the mud, you should be able to pick up some serious speed as you go.","","Pędź przez otwarte pola w kierunku Edynburga i postaraj się nie skosić wszystkich kamiennych murków po drodze. Od farmy wiatrowej droga wiedzie ciągle w dół, więc jeśli tylko nie zakopiesz się w błocie, to uda ci się nieźle rozpędzić."

Take extra care over the precarious jumps!","","Ściany kamieniołomu umożliwiają wytyczanie ciekawych tras wyścigowych. Na przykład ten tor pnie się po brzegu kamieniołomu aż do rosnących wokół niego drzew, po czym prowadzi w dół po wąskich półkach wyrobiska. Tylko ostrożnie na hopach!"

Ta niezwykłej długości trasa prowadzi przez Broadway, wzdłuż zalewu Derwent, zahacza o torfowiska i las, wiedzie koło jeziora, a potem wraca na oświetlony blaskiem fajerwerków festiwal Horizon. To będzie coś niesamowitego!"

You'll also have to contend with furrowed fields, thickets of trees and fences, while travelling at high speed.","","Trasa tego zaskakująco trudnego rajdu przełajowego prowadzi od wioski Broadway do Ashbrook. Kierowcy wielokrotnie będą przejeżdżać przez rzekę dzielącą obie miejscowości i będą się też musieli pogodzić z pobrużdżonymi polami, kępami drzew oraz płotami, które będą przeszkadzać w szybkiej jeździe."
"5381","Derwentwater is so serene that it regularly freezes over in the winter. The perfect opportunity for some drag racing on ice! Winter tires are definitely recommended if you hope to gain any traction on the frozen surface.","","Jezioro Derwent jest tak spokojne, że zimą regularnie zamarza. Dzięki temu stanowi idealną miejscówkę do organizacji wyścigów typu drag na lodzie! Jeśli chcesz mieć jakąkolwiek przyczepność na zamarzniętej nawierzchni, to pamiętaj, by założyć zimówki."
"5382","Greendale Aerodrome presents some interesting challenges for drag racing. The concrete is old, crumbling, and dusty, with cracks and weathering for good measure. A delicate launch is necessary to find the sweet spot between your wheels slipping and bogging down.","","Wyścigi równoległe na lotnisku Greendale to bardzo ciekawe wyzwanie. Betonowa nawierzchnia jest stara, popękana i zakurzona, poznaczona pęknięciami i nadgryziona zębem czasu. Kierowca musi ruszyć z wyczuciem tak, aby uniknąć poślizgu i jednocześnie nie ugrzęznąć na starcie."
"5383","On a hot summer's day, there's no better place to be than on a sandy beach, ice-cream in hand, sun cream at the ready, the smell of fish, chips and sea-salt on the breeze. The only thing that could make it better is some high-octane drag racing, wouldn't you agree?","","W gorący letni dzień najlepiej znaleźć się na piaszczystej plaży, zajadać lody, mieć pod ręką olejek do opalania i wyczuwać w morskiej bryzie lekką nutę smażonej ryby z frytkami. Do pełni szczęścia brakuje tylko wyścigów równoległych na wysokich obrotach, nie sądzisz?"
"5384","Ask any racer. Any real racer. It don't matter if you win by an inch or a mile. Winning's winning.","","Zapytaj kierowcę. Jakiegokolwiek prawdziwego kierowcę. Nieważne, czy wygrywasz o milimetr, czy o całą milę. Wygrana to wygrana."
"5385","Weave through the trees and bluebells of Lakehurst Forest in spring as you do battle with the Horizon Motocross team in the Ford #14 Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing GRC Fiesta!","","Przemykaj między rozkwitającymi wiosną drzewami i kwiatami lasu Lakehurst, tocząc bój z motocrossową drużyną Horizon za kierownicą samochodu Ford #14 Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing GRC Fiesta!"
"5386","The Horizon Tech Team have found a training programme buried deep within the software of an M12S Warthog CST. Seems like some kind of evacuation exercise!","","Ekipa techników Horizon odkryła program szkoleniowy zapisany głęboko w pamięci Guźca M12S CST. To chyba jakieś ćwiczenia ewakuacyjne!"
"5387","Race through the wetlands of Rannoch Valley against an all-terrain monster! Come hill or high water, the Horizon Hovercraft can take it on. It's up to you to prove that 4 wheels are still king with the Toyota #1 T100 Baja Truck!","","Ścigaj się przez mokradła doliny Rannoch przeciwko terenowemu potworowi! Czy to wzgórza czy głęboka woda, poduszkowiec Horizon da sobie z tym radę. Twoim zadaniem jest udowodnić, że 4 koła Trophy Trucka Toyota T100 #1 wciąż mają przewagę!"
"5388","Duke it out with a delta wing jet aircraft. You're in the Aston Martin Vulcan for this one, which has a V12 engine instead of wings… should be a good fight! Remember: Through adversity, to the stars.","","Stocz pojedynek z odrzutowcem ze skrzydłem delta. Tym razem siądziesz za kierownicą samochodu Aston Martin Vulcan, wyposażonego w silnik V12 zamiast skrzydeł. To będzie widowiskowa walka! Pamiętaj: przez trudy do gwiazd."
"5389","Head west from the Festival Site down the steep hill leading to Ambleside, but, the route bypasses the village to follow the edge of the lake instead, looping around Tarn Hows in an anti-clockwise direction. There's a nice sequence of corners known as Sudmoss towards the end.","","Z miasteczka festiwalowego udaj się na zachód, w dół stromego zbocza prowadzącego do Ambleside. Trasa omija jednak wioskę i prowadzi nad jeziorem, okrążając Tarn Hows w kierunku przeciwnym do ruchu wskazówek zegara. Na koniec spodziewaj się sympatycznej serii zakrętów, znanej jako Sudmoss."
"5390","Horizon's most gruelling circuit, only for the most veteran drivers. This gargantuan route takes you on an epic high-speed tour of the UK; from Ambleside to Glen Rannoch, then Edinburgh, continuing to Bamburgh, and finally visiting Broadway before turning north again. Good luck!","","Najbardziej wyczerpująca trasa w Horizon, tylko dla najtwardszych weteranów wyścigów. Ten potężnych rozmiarów wyścig zabierze cię na przyspieszoną wycieczkę po Wielkiej Brytanii: od Ambleside, przez Glen Rannoch, Edynburg, Bamburgh aż do Broadway. Potem trasa kieruje się z powrotem na północ. Powodzenia!"
"5391","A short hillclimb sprint from Ambleside, up the switchbacks into Lakehurst Forest, before heading to the Horizon Festival site where you'll be welcomed at the finish line by the cheering crowd. Make sure you handbrake turn across the finish line to look extra cool.","","Krótki sprint pod górkę z Ambleside, po serpentynach do lasu Lakehurst, a potem prosto do miasteczka festiwalowego, gdzie na końcu trasy powita cię wiwatujący tłum. Najlepiej wjedź na metę zakręcając na ręcznym – zrobisz furorę."
"5392","Rookie drivers start out here, to prove they can handle their car. Blast out of the festival site and follow a scenic route to the south, passing Tarn Hows and finishing down by the lakes. Tune your car for downforce and see how fast you can take the final sequence of corners!","","Ta trasa to idealne miejsce dla początkujących kierowców, którzy chcą pokazać, że są już w stanie zapanować nad swoimi autami. Wyjedź z rykiem silnika z miasteczka festiwalowego i skieruj się ku malowniczej drodze na południe, mijając Tarn Hows i kończąc przy jeziorach. Dostosuj siłę docisku i sprawdź, jak szybko uda ci się pokonać ostatnią serię zakrętów!"
"5393","Don't get distracted by the music as you head through the Festival on this route. Tune your car up and before you know it we'll take smashing records to a whole new level.","","Na tej trasie przejeżdżasz przez festiwal, więc nie daj się rozproszyć muzyce! Dobrze wyreguluj swoje auto, a zanim się obejrzysz, będziesz miał pobity kolejny rekord."
"5394","This route's pretty gentle, but that doesn't mean there's time for sightseeing. Get your engine prepped to break some speed records, then go out there and tear up!","","To dość łagodna droga, co nie znaczy, że będzie czas na zwiedzanie. Szykuj silnik na bicie rekordów prędkości, udaj się na start i pozwól mu nabrać obrotów!"
"5395","A clean-cut asphalt route if ever there was one. You may have a tough time with some of those tight turns; don't take them too hard, you want your times to count, don't you?","","To chyba najczystsza asfaltowa droga na świecie. Niektóre z ciasnych zakrętów mogą sprawić ci małe problemy, więc nie bierz ich zbyt gwałtownie. Przecież chcesz uzyskać jak najlepszy czas, prawda?"
"5396","I hope your brakes can handle this monster. The second half of this winding route will have you barrelling downhill past the sunken ruins of Fenholm, so enjoy the ride.","","Oby twoje hamulce dały radę tej potwornej trasie. Druga połowa tego zakręconego szlaku poprowadzi cię w dół zbocza przy zatopionych ruinach w Fenholm. Przyjemnej jazdy!"
"5397","This route forces some hard turns on a steep, muddy incline. Strong acceleration is vital for getting a good time, but also vital for kicking up some mud!","","Na tej trasie będzie trzeba pokonać kilka trudnych zakrętów na stromym, błotnistym zboczu. Aby uzyskać dobry czas (i wyrzucić w powietrze sporo błota), będziesz potrzebować czegoś z porządnym przyspieszeniem."
"5398","No time to take in the natural splendor! I mean, natural splendor is great and all, but everything looks better when it's blurry, so grab a car that can stick the corners and nail the straights.","","Nie ma czasu na zachwycanie się pięknem natury! Oczywiście nie mam nic przeciwko naturze, ale wszystko wygląda lepiej, gdy staje się rozmyte od prędkości, więc wsiadaj za kółko auta, które będzie zwrotne na zakrętach i nie ustąpi pola na prostych."
"5399","Be careful with this one. It starts off simple enough, letting you ramp up some speed, but then it tests your handling with some extreme corners. Keep control at all times!","","Na tę trasę lepiej uważać. Zaczyna się niewinnie, pozwala się rozpędzić, lecz potem bezlitośnie sprawdza twoją sterowność na naprawdę ekstremalnych zakrętach. Nie trać kontroli ani na chwilę!"
"5400","This route's smooth curves favour speed over grip. Glide around Fortune Island's hills and press the pedal to the floor!","","Na delikatnych krzywiznach tego toru prędkość liczy się dużo bardziej niż przyczepność. Śmigaj po wzgórzach Fortune Island i gaz do dechy!"
"5401","A balanced car is best here. Deceptively gentle slopes lead to some truly tight turns, but once you're through those, it's a flat-out dash to the finish line.","","Tutaj zdecydowanie przyda się wszechstronny samochód. Spokojne zbocza mają tylko uśpić twoją czujność, zanim stawisz czoła bardzo ciasnym zakrętom. Gdy już je pokonasz, czeka cię szalona gonitwa prosto do mety."
"5402","The Needle Climb is not for the faint of heart. The winding bends make up the largest section of paved mountain switchbacks we've ever seen at the Horizon Festival. Keep tight, specific control. It's called needle for a reason.","","Stromy podjazd to nie miejsce dla osób o słabym sercu. Te kręte utwardzone serpentyny to najdłuższa tego rodzaju trasa na całym festiwalu Horizon. Tu potrzebna jest aptekarska precyzja, mistrzowskie umiejętności i stalowe nerwy. W końcu nie bez powodu nazywają to miejsce stromym podjazdem."
"5403","Even more adrenaline fuelled than the climb is the descent. You'll have gravity working with you, or against you, depending on how you look at it. Regardless, it will make braking into those tight turns all the trickier…","","Zjazd zapewnia jeszcze więcej emocji niż wjazd. Grawitacja w końcu działa na twoją korzyść (albo niekorzyść, różnie bywa). W każdym razie, żeby zmieścić się w tych wąskich zakrętach potrzeba będzie nie tylko mistrza kierownicy, ale i solidnych hamulców…"
"5404","It's too easy to get caught up in the fun of the steep, endless decline that defines this exhilarating route. Don't. Keep under control through the hard angles before rocketing through the final straight and over the finish line.","","Tak łatwo dać się ponieść przyjemnej jeździe w dół stromego, niekończącego się zbocza, które jest wizytówką tej ekscytującej trasy. Nie popełnij tego błędu. Nie trać kontroli na trudnych zakrętach, pogrzejesz sobie później, na ostatniej prostej w stronę mety."
"5405","The first half of this route will be tricky. As you head down the mountain you'll be faced with some very tight turns, but if you make it past them, put your foot down and enjoy the coastal views. Once you're up against the bay it's smooth sailing 'til the end.","","Pierwsza połowa tej trasy nie jest łatwa. Pędząc w dół górskiego zbocza, napotkasz kilka bardzo ciasnych zakrętów. Gdy już zostawisz je za sobą, daj gaz do dechy i ciesz się morskimi widoczkami. Gdy dotrzesz do zatoki, złap pomyślny wiatr w kierunku mety."
"5406","This route will take you right along the edge of the island. Fine margins will make the difference between sweeping through the narrow roads, and getting caught on the wall protecting you from the plunge. A well-balanced vehicle is best here.","","Tą drogą dotrzesz do samego skraju wyspy. Między gładkim przejazdem po wąskich dróżkach a spektakularną kolizją z murem oddzielającym cię od przepaści znajduje się bardzo cienka granica. Najlepiej sprawdzi się tutaj jak najbardziej wszechstronny pojazd."
"5407","It's a bumpy road ahead, so prepare your car's suspension accordingly. Oh, and try not to look down.","","Przed nami sporo wybojów, więc dobrze przygotuj swoje zawieszenie. I lepiej nie patrz w dół."
"5408","This route is compact, so don't expect to reach your top speed. Climbing up and down the hill calls for optimised handling and grip, taking those corners as tight as you can!","","To bardzo kameralna trasa, więc raczej nie rozwiniesz tu maksymalnej prędkości. Czeka cię za to wspinaczka i zjazdy po wzgórzach, a do tego przyda się optymalizacja przyczepności i sterowności, aby brać te zakręty tak ciasno, jak tylko się da."
"5409","This tight route will keep you turning, as you duck under bridges and up through the castle. Tune your car for acceleration and don't worry too much about maxing out your top speed. Oh, and crash through the water for me.","","Od tej wąskiej trasy prowadzącej przez zamek pewnie zakręci ci się w głowie, więc trzymaj ją nisko podczas przejazdów pod mostami. Zadbaj o dobre przyspieszenie i nie martw się, jeśli nie osiągniesz maksymalnej prędkości. Prośba ode mnie: przejedź przez wodę!"
"5410","This complex route has no sympathy for those who take a corner poorly. The initial hairpin turn is punishing, so optimise for grip to stay on the road, and away from those walls!","","Ta zawiła trasa nie ma taryfy ulgowej dla tych, którzy słabo radzą sobie z zakrętami. Pierwszy nawrót daje niezły wycisk, więc zoptymalizuj swoją furę z myślą o przyczepności, aby pozostać na drodze i uniknąć bliskiego spotkania z murami!"
"5411","Ah, a nice drive along the beach… that you won't have time to enjoy, because you'll be taking those dirt road curves at top speed!","","Nie ma to jak miła przejażdżka po plaży… Niestety, nie będziesz mieć czasu na podziwianie widoków podczas szalonego przejazdu po nieutwardzonych zakrętach na pełnej prędkości!"
"5412","This one's filled with gorgeous views out to sea. You'll be rolling towards the coast at high speed, skidding through the muddy corners before the final, exhilarating push to the finish line.","","Ta trasa jest wprost pełna zachwycających morskich krajobrazów. Przetoczysz się z wielką prędkością w stroną wybrzeża, a pod koniec prześlizgniesz się po błotnistych zakrętach, przed ostateczną gonitwą w stronę linii mety."
"5413","This route starts off with some deep, winding turns as you spiral out of the peak of The Giant's Dolmen. It flattens out for a stretch of clean asphalt near the end though, so take a dirt-friendly car that still has enough power to turn heads on straightaways.","","Trasę otwiera kilka głębokich zakrętów, które rozpoczynają zjazd z dolmenu giganta. Bliżej finału teren robi się bardziej płaski, a pod kołami pojawia się gładziutki asfalt, więc zabierz na ten wyścig wszechstronne auto, którym pewnie pojedziesz po drogach nieutwardzonych i które będzie mieć wystarczającą moc, by popędzić jak strzała po prostych."
"5414","There are some beautiful views along this route, but you won't have time to see them as you'll be blasting up and down hills, past every rock, tree, and deer at top speed.","","Na tej trasie jest co podziwiać, ale nie musisz się tym martwić, bo czeka cię jazda z zawrotną prędkością po wzgórzach i każda skała, drzewo czy jeleń będzie tylko rozmytą plamką za szybą."
"5415","The mountainous terrain of this abandoned island stretches from coast to coast. This journey is expansive, becoming an exploration of verticality… good handling will take you far.","","Ta opuszczona wyspa charakteryzuje się górskim ukształtowaniem terenu. Trasa zabierze cię w podróż po pionowym wymiarze… Z dobrą sterownością daleko zajedziesz."
"5416","I hope you don't mind getting a bit wet? Great, because there's some deep water on this dirt track that requires your attention. Still, this is about as speed-friendly as dirt racing gets. Put on your raincoat, put the pedal to the floor and drench those crowds.","","Jesteś z cukru? Nie? To dobrze, bo na tej trasie jest głęboka woda, na którą trzeba uważać. I jak to na wyścigach crossowych – można tu nielicho przygrzać. Załóż sztormiak, wdepnij gaz do dechy i pojedź ochlapać cały ten tłum."
"5417","Take a car with good clearance and get ready to make a splash. The amount of water on this circuit almost cries out for an amphibious vehicle as you'll be spending your time wading through the bay.","","Przyszykuj samochód z porządnym prześwitem i przygotuj się na kąpiel. Potrzeba tu prawdziwej amfibii, bo na torze jest tyle wody, że większość czasu spędzisz brodząc w niej po klamki."
"5418","Feel like taking a dip? If paddling at the seaside of a creepy abandoned island is your idea of a nice holiday, this is the track for you. Rocket through the hills by the lighthouse but make sure your car is ready for the water.","","Masz ochotę na kąpiel? Jeśli twoją definicją miłego urlopu jest wiosłowanie wokół strasznej, opuszczonej wyspy, to mamy trasę w sam raz dla ciebie. Popędź po wzgórzach wokół latarni morskiej, lecz wcześniej upewnij się, że twojemu autu nie zaszkodzi odrobina wody."
"5419","Straight over the top you go! Thunder down the hill and across the island. This route takes you through some tight passageways, so take care not to bump into anything that doesn't shatter on impact.","","Pora na wspinaczkę! Pędź w dół po stoku wzgórza i poprzez całą wyspę. Ta trasa poprowadzi cię przez kilka wąskich przejść, więc uważaj, żeby nie trafić w nic twardszego od twojego zderzaka."
"5420","You'll be flying around this track, literally. It's set right on the edge of the sharp cliffs of the island. Look left as you hit the jumps and you'll see a steep drop to the ocean below. You'll want to keep your eyes on the road for the landing though!","","Po tym torze będziesz dosłownie latać, nie żartuję. Wytyczyliśmy go na samej krawędzi stromych klifów. Gdy wyskoczysz, spójrz w lewo, a zobaczysz, jak daleko jest do oceanu. Ale już przy lądowaniu lepiej nie spuszczaj oczu z drogi!"
"5421","This is as smooth as a Cross Country ride can get, but you'll still be battling through muddy floodwater in sunken Fenholm. There's also a pretty sweet jump that flings you into the second half of the track, don't neglect your suspension.","","Jak na rajd przełajowy to wcale nie jest jeszcze taka ostra trasa, ale i tak czeka cię starcie z mętną wodą, która zalała Fenholm. Mamy tu całkiem niezły wyskok, który przeniesie cię na drugą część trasy, więc uważaj na swoje zawieszenie."
"5422","We start by dropping you off a cliff in this tricky route, so be prepared to spend as much time in the air and water as you do with wheels on the ground. A vehicle with a high ride-height and good suspension will be necessary.","","Na początek tej trasy pełnej niespodzianek mamy zamiar zrzucić cię klifu, więc przygotuj się na tyle samo czasu spędzonego w wodzie i w powietrzu, co z kołami na drodze. Będzie ci potrzebny pojazd z wysokim prześwitem i niezłym zawieszeniem."
"5423","Welcome to the Kraken. This route has a bit of everything: tight turns, long straights, and a path spanning most of Fortune Island. Are you ready?","","Witamy na Krakenie. Ta trasa to mieszanka wszystkiego: ostrych zakrętów, długich prostych oraz imponującej ścieżki wiodącej wokół niemal całej wyspy Fortune Island. Gotowi?"
"5424","You're in for the long haul now. The Leviathan spans all of Fortune Island, with plenty of long roads to test your speed and tight turns to keep you in control. Bring your very best.","","Szykuj się na niezłą przeprawę. Lewiatan rozciąga się na całej wyspie Fortune Island i jest tu pełno długich dróg, na których sprawdzisz swoją prędkość, oraz ciasnych zakrętów, które przetestują twoje panowanie nad autem. Przyjedź swoim najlepszym samochodem."
"5425","The Falcon Loop is an awesome piece of classic track design, and allows you to hit your top speed like no other. Are you ready?","","Falcon Loop to świetny przykład klasycznego toru, który jak żaden inny pozwoli ci osiągać maksymalne prędkości. To co, widzimy się na starcie?"
"5426","This track has a ton of technical turns but don't hold back when you reach the outer edge, put the pedal to the floor and burn some rubber!","","Na tej trasie aż roi się od technicznych zakrętów, ale gdy już dotrzesz do zewnętrznej krawędzi, wciśnij gaz do dechy i pal gumę!"
"5427","The stands are filled with LEGO Minifigures ready to watch you race. Make sure your tires have solid grip for this sharp-turning track, then go out there and impress them!","","Trybuny pełne są minifigurek lego obserwujących twoje popisy. Czeka cię sporo ostrych zakrętów, więc upewnij się, że twoje opony mają odpowiednią przyczepność. Takiej publiczności nie wolno zawieść!"
"5428","For this desert-spanning circuit, make sure you keep your vehicle under tight control. Drive fast but keep clear of the walls on those deep turns to keep your lap time from being abducted.","","Na tym pustynnym torze musisz uważać na swoje auto. Jedź szybko, lecz przy głębszych zakrętach trzymaj się z dala od ścian, bo twój dobry czas okrążenia porwą obcy!"
"5429","Get ready to kick up some dust and sand on this desert route. You'll probably end up with sand in your shoes, though. Asphalt will be in short supply!","","Na tej pustynnej trasie pył i piach będą lecieć spod kół aż miło! Nie łudź się, na pewno skończysz z piaskiem w butach. Asfaltu tu mają jak na lekarstwo!"
"5430","Take care with this route. First it'll test your engines, and then it'll test your brakes. Get the best run up you can but if you take those turns too hard, your lap time will be pushing up daisies.","","Z tą trasą trzeba postępować ostrożnie. Najpierw da popalić twojemu silnikowi, a potem hamulcom. Nie wahaj się gnać na złamanie karku, ale jeśli za ostro weźmiesz te zakręty, to twój czas okrążenia pójdzie do piachu."
"5431","Experience the majestic brick-built woodlands of LEGO Valley… or just take the fastest car you can get your hands on and blast through those straights. Your choice, really.","","Poznaj imponujące, klockowe lasy Doliny LEGO… Lub po prostu wskocz za kółko swojej najszybszej fury i sprawdź, jak sobie poradzisz, pędząc po tych prostych. Twój wybór."
"5432","There'll be turns, turns, and more turns in this route, so don't worry about your top speed. Oh, and watch out for the streetlights, they may be fun to smash through but they will slow you down!","","Ten tor to zakręty, zakręty i jeszcze raz zakręty, więc maksymalna prędkość nie gra tu wielkiej roli. Uważaj na latarnie: może i fajnie skosić jedną lub dwie, ale ucierpi na tym twoje tempo!"
"5433","We asked for all the traffic to leave the city so we could show you what real Brickchester driving can be like! Keep those corners tight and go, go, go when the empty roads open up.","","Udało nam się załatwić zamknięcie ruchu ulicznego w całym mieście, aby można było pokazać, jak tak naprawdę powinno się jeździć po Klockowym Zdroju! Zachowaj precyzję na ciasnych zakrętach i gazuj, gdy tylko zobaczysz otwarty skrawek drogi."
"5434","Let the Lighthouse guide you to victory. Keep alert, for all the sleepy turns early on you'll need to be awake for the big drop!","","Niech latarnia poprowadzi cię ku zwycięstwu. Tylko nie trać czujności na pierwszych, sennych zakrętach, bo za chwilę będzie cię czekać spory spadek, na którym trzeba zachować trzeźwość umysłu!"
"5435","Those long coastal roads are just begging for someone to zoom through them at top speed! Just be careful, the turn at the southern tip of the Valley is a sharp one…","","Te długie drogi na wybrzeżu aż się proszą, aby ktoś śmignął po nich z pełną prędkością! Tylko ostrożnie, na południowym krańcu doliny znajduje się naprawdę ostry zakręt…"
"5436","Don't let the starting position fool you. This is a giant cross country route spanning LEGO Valley in it's entirety, from North to South. Be ready for any terrain, and prove you're a jack of all trades.","","Nie daj się oszukać na linii startu. To ogromny rajd przełajowy wiodący przez całą dolinę LEGO, od północy do samego jej południa. Przyszykuj auto na każdy rodzaj nawierzchni i pokaż swoją wszechstronność."

You'll need to keep your car steady through the sandy dunes before taking a refreshing dive into the pools of the oasis.","","Ten pustynny rajd przełajowy odbywa się na piasku i wodzie! Zadbaj o stabilność swego auta podczas jazdy przez wydmy, a w nagrodę zaznasz ochłody w wodach oazy."
"5438","We've had to cancel all flights to LEGO Valley for this Airport Dash… you do NOT want to know how much this is costing us! That said, this tight figure-eight route does have you whizzing past LEGO helicopters and ducking under aircraft hangers, so it was worth it.","","Na potrzeby tego wydarzenia na lotnisku musieliśmy odwołać wszystkie loty do Doliny LEGO… Nie chcesz wiedzieć, ile za to zapłaciliśmy! Za to na tej trasie w kształcie ósemki będziesz pomykać obok helikopterów LEGO i pędzić przez hangary lotnicze, więc trzeba przyznać – było warto."
"5439","Prepare to get a bit wet as you dash along Brickchester's waterways, and try your best not to clip the buildings!","","Pędząc po drogach wodnych Klockowego Zdroju niechybnie się zmoczysz. Jedź ostrożnie, żeby nie stuknąć w pobliskie budynki!"

Just make sure to keep control during those corners, or your lap time may go extinct.","","Ucieknij z pustyni i śmignij przez pola na tej długiej trasie, na której aż roi się od kości dinozaurów. Nie trać kontroli na zakrętach, bo twój czas okrążenia też wyginie."

"15694","Better now you can [BOLD:show us where to go]!","","Świetnie, możesz teraz [BOLD:wskazać nam drogę]!"
"15695","Erm, was that a [BOLD:wrecked Viking longship]?","","Hm, czy to był [BOLD:wrak statku wikingów]?"
"15696","More like a [BOLD:whole fleet] of [BOLD:wrecked longships]!","","Raczej [BOLD:cała armada rozbitych drakkarów]!"
"15697","Pilot says [BOLD:this] is the [BOLD:best dropoff] point, the [BOLD:rest] is all [BOLD:sheer cliffs].","","Zdaniem pilota [BOLD:to najlepsze miejsce], żeby wyskoczyć, bo [BOLD:wszędzie] dokoła [BOLD:są same klify]."

"15699","That was Joel. [BOLD:Transport] is [BOLD:thirty seconds out].","","To był Joel. [BOLD:Transport] będzie za [BOLD:pół minuty]."
"15700","Well… sort of [BOLD:all of the above] really.","","W pewnym sensie [BOLD:wszystko naraz]."
"15701","[BOLD:Here’s our ride]. Let’s get everything loaded.","","[BOLD:Oto i nasz transport]. Zapakujmy wszystko do środka."
"15702","Joel's sorted out the transport… things could get a little choppy on the way.","","Joel załatwiał transport… więc po drodze może trochę rzucać."
"15703","Keira has given me a heads up that you might need some [BOLD:help on] this [BOLD:riddle]. “This [BOLD:Swedish Knight] is ready for action, the [BOLD:Lakeside Speed zone] will test its traction.” [BOLD:Complete] the [BOLD:Lakeside Speed Zone] in the [BOLD:Volvo Iron Knight].

"15704","I shouldn't be telling you this…but it looks like you need some [BOLD:help on] this [BOLD:riddle]. “[BOLD:Will-o’-the-wisp Speed Zone] is said to be silly, especially when driven in a [BOLD:Jeep named Willy].” You’ll need to [BOLD:complete] the [BOLD:Will-o’-the-wisp Speed Zone] in a [BOLD:Willys Jeep]. Get it?","","Nie powinnam ci tego mówić… ale wygląda na to, że potrzebujesz [BOLD:pomocy] z tą [BOLD:zagadką].

Ta jest całkiem prosta! ''Legenda głosi, że [BOLD:3-gwiazdkowe R8] [BOLD:pani jeziora] nosi''. Musisz [BOLD:ukończyć fotoradar nad jeziorem] w [BOLD:Audi R8]."

Odparłem, że na Fortune Island są takie drogi, że może nastąpi to szybciej, niż sądzi. W końcu pozwolił ci na jazdę próbną."
"15725","This is the [BOLD:HSV Maloo Gen-F]. It [BOLD:belongs to] my friend [BOLD:Josh], who [BOLD:races in] something called [BOLD:Formula Drift].

"15728","My friend [BOLD:Josh is] actually [BOLD:Australian], you see. [BOLD:Hence] the [BOLD:Holden] and the [BOLD:right-hand drive].

To może również wyjaśniać jego nagłą potrzebę zjeżdżania z trasy i… hmm kręcenia bączków."
"15729","[BOLD:Why] am I [BOLD:on Fortune Island]? Well lately I’ve been taking a keen interest in history and geology you see, and… nah, I’m only kidding! It’s [BOLD:Drift Club], of course.

Jest bardzo wrażliwy na tym punkcie."
"15732","[BOLD:Plenty of excitement] in this route but a [BOLD:good amount of technical skill] too. I do like technicalities you see.","","Ta trasa potrafi dostarczyć [BOLD:mnóstwo emocji], ale wymaga [BOLD:niezłej techniki]. Na szczęście technika to moja specjalność."
"15733","[BOLD:Excellent]! Now do you [BOLD:think this should be] a feature in [BOLD:the regular Drift Club newsletter, or] should I start a [BOLD:special Fortune Island Drift Club newsletter]? You know what, I’ll figure that part out.","","[BOLD:Świetnie]! Sądzisz, że to [BOLD:powinien] być [BOLD:stały element newslettera Drift Clubu], czy może warto stworzyć [BOLD:osobny na potrzeby Fortune Island]? OK, sam się nad tym zastanowię."
"15734","[BOLD:Justin’s Mustang] has an old [BOLD:NASCAR 4-speed gearbox]. So, make sure you take good care of her.","","[BOLD:Mustang Justina] ma starą, [BOLD:czterobiegową skrzynię biegów typu NASCAR], więc dbaj o nią."
"15735","How are you [BOLD:enjoying Fortune Island]? I have to say [BOLD:I’m rather liking] the [BOLD:isolation and the solitude]. I brought a nice big stack of aftermarket parts catalogues to read.","","Jak ci się podoba [BOLD:na Fortune Island]? Muszę przyznać, [BOLD:że izolacja i odosobnienie] przypadły mi [BOLD:do gustu]. Zabrałem ze sobą do czytania cały stos katalogów części z rynku wtórnego."
"15736","What do you think of the Viper? You know, [BOLD:Dean wouldn’t] even [BOLD:hurt a fly], but [BOLD:his car frightens] the life out of me.","","Jak tam ten Viper? [BOLD:Dean] nie skrzywdziłby [BOLD:nawet muchy], ale jego auto mnie po prostu [BOLD:przeraża]."
"15737","I actually know the Drift Clubber who owns this one quite well and we worked on the customization together so if you ding it up you’ll have us both to answer to, catch my… I mean uh, understand?","","Znam dobrze klubowicza, do którego należy ta maszyna. Wspólnie pracowaliśmy nad jej modyfikacją, więc jeśli ją uszkodzisz, to będziesz się przed nami spowiadał, kapu… rozumiesz?"
"15738","[BOLD:This one belongs] to my friend [BOLD:Dean]. He’s a laidback [BOLD:Irish lad] whose [BOLD:Viper SRT10] produces a decidedly un-laidback [BOLD:1350 brake horsepower].

To wyluzowany [BOLD:Irlandczyk] z bardzo nerwowym autem [BOLD:Viper SRT10] o mocy [BOLD:1350 koni mechanicznych]. Używaj go z rozwagą."
"15739","I've been scouting the Island personally. This is [BOLD:the best drift route] yet.","","Osobiście przemierzyłem tę wyspę. Nie znajdziesz na niej [BOLD:lepszej trasy do driftu]."

"15741","Hey, [BOLD:welcome back]! The way people have been viewing your videos, Fortune Island will be swamped with Drift Clubbers before long. How good will that be!","","[BOLD:Witaj z powrotem]! Patrząc na to, jaką popularnością cieszą się twoje filmy wśród odbiorców, już wkrótce Fortune Island będzie oblegane przez klubowiczów. Ależ tu się będzie działo!"
"15742","They tell me that [BOLD:240SX body] is pretty [BOLD:standard] among [BOLD:Formula Drift] drivers. Though of course, Matt has put more gizmos and gadgets in his than a Swiss Army Knife.","","Nadwozie [BOLD:modelu 240SX] [BOLD:nie różni się zasadniczo] od innych samochodów startujących w [BOLD:Formula Drift]. Różnica polega na tym, że Matt wsadził tam mnóstwo bajerów i gadżetów. Jest tego więcej niż w szwajcarskim scyzoryku."
"15743","This one’s [BOLD:a new arrival]. I don't know the Drift Clubber but the message they sent with the car just says, “She’s been good to me. She deserves to go to Drift Heaven”.","","Ten [BOLD:trafił do nas niedawno]. Nie znam klubowicza, do którego należał, ale dołączył do niego krótką wiadomość: ''Dobrze mi służył. Zasługuje, by trafić do drifterskiego raju''."
"15744","This is my friend [BOLD:Matt’s ’97 Nissan 240SX]. It has a [BOLD:7 liter supercharged V8] putting out [BOLD:1250 brake horsepower].

Auto ma pod maską [BOLD:silnik V8 z kompresorem o pojemności 7 litrów] i mocy [BOLD:1250 koni mechanicznych]. Matt już nim nie jeździ, Bóg raczy wiedzieć dlaczego."
"15745","Remember, [BOLD:shift the weight forward] and you [BOLD:lose grip in the rear]. Now shift your rear and [BOLD:get going].","","Pamiętaj, że [BOLD:przenosząc ciężar na przód], [BOLD:tracisz przyczepność z tyłu]. A teraz podnieś swój tył i [BOLD:ruszaj]."
"15746","I’m quite [BOLD:serious about] making [BOLD:Fortune Island] the [BOLD:permanent home of Drift Club], you know. I mean, how are we ever going to top this place?","","[BOLD:Całkiem poważnie] zastanawiam się nad [BOLD:przeniesieniem siedziby Drift Clubu] na [BOLD:Fortune Island] na stałe. Jaka jest w końcu szansa, że znajdziemy coś lepszego?"
"15747","We’re [BOLD:thinking about] making [BOLD:Fortune Island] the [BOLD:permanent headquarters of Drift Club], what do you think? I’ll send some letters. Trust me. Anyway, let’s get on with the Drifting shall we?","","[BOLD:Zastanawiamy się], czy nie przenieść [BOLD:siedziby Drift Clubu] na stałe na [BOLD:Fortune Island]. Co o tym sądzisz? Wyślę kilka listów. Zaufaj mi. W międzyczasie podriftujmy trochę, OK?"
"15748","That’s a [BOLD:Formula Drift machine], so you’ve got [BOLD:over 70 degrees of steer angle] to play with! By which I mean, try not to pitch it over a cliff.","","To [BOLD:maszyna Formula Drift] z kątem skrętu wynoszącym [BOLD:ponad 70 stopni]! Baw się ładnie i postaraj się nie zrzucić go z klifu."
"15749","I really wanted to see you have a go in this one, so I might have promised the Drift Clubber who owns it you’d sign an autograph. And visit them. And stay for tea... dah, never mind, we’ll talk about it later.","","Zdecydowanie polecam ci ten tutaj, bo, widzisz, obiecałem jego właścicielowi, że dasz mu autograf… i do niego wpadniesz… na herbatkę. Dobra, nieważne, porozmawiamy o tym później."
"15750","So, here’s [BOLD:another 240SX], [BOLD:’96] this time. [BOLD:Belongs to my friend Corey]. I told you that body was highly customizable. This one has a [BOLD:V8 twin turbo] and only puts out a measly [BOLD:1150 brake horsepower].","","Kolejny [BOLD:model 240SX], tym razem rocznik [BOLD:96]. Należy do [BOLD:mojego znajomego Coreya]. Jak już mówiłem, to nadwozie to świetny materiał do modyfikacji. Ta konkretna maszyna ma [BOLD:silnik V8 z dwiema turbosprężarkami], ale liche [BOLD:1150 koni mechanicznych]."
"15751","I have some [BOLD:lovely switchbacks] you might like to [BOLD:introduce to] our good friend [BOLD:Functional Oversteer].","","Mam dla ciebie trasę pełną [BOLD:niezłych serpentyn], na których możesz poćwiczyć [BOLD:kontrolowanie nadsterowności]."
"15752","Yes! We’re one step [BOLD:closer to claiming this island]. The Drift Club executive committee are meeting tonight, if you'd like to come. We’ll have biscuits.","","Tak! Jesteśmy o [BOLD:krok bliżej na drodze do zdobycia wyspy]. Jeśli masz ochotę, to dziś wieczorem zbiera się komitet wykonawczy Drift Clubu. Będą ciasteczka."
"15753","Hey, so I’ve been [BOLD:looking into] making [BOLD:Fortune Island] our [BOLD:permanent HQ]. I’ve floated it to Horizon, and to the Drift Club executive committee. I’d take it to the local council if only we knew where they were based.","","Hej, [BOLD:myślę] nad przeniesieniem naszej [BOLD:siedziby głównej] na [BOLD:Fortune Island]. Przedstawiłem ten pomysł oficjelom festiwalu Horizon i komitetowi wykonawczemu Drift Clubu. Wybrałbym się również do lokalnego samorządu, gdybyśmy tylko wiedzieli, gdzie się znajduje."
"15754","Feel those [BOLD:soft springs]? This is exactly what I mean! Believe it or not, [BOLD:Formula Drift] is [BOLD:all about] how much [BOLD:traction you can maintain]!","","Czujesz te [BOLD:miękkie amortyzatory]? Właśnie to mam na myśli! Uwierz lub nie, ale w [BOLD:Formula Drift] chodzi [BOLD:przede wszystkim] o [BOLD:zachowanie jak największej przyczepności]!"
"15755","[BOLD:Drift Clubbers] are [BOLD:an exacting lot]. Whoever loaned us this [BOLD:wants to see] what you can do with [BOLD:finesse, rather than power]. If it belongs to the person I think it does, never disagree with her about suspension geometry.","","[BOLD:Klubowicze] są [BOLD:bardzo wymagający]. Ten, kto nam go udostępnił, chce, żebyśmy [BOLD:wykazali się finezją], a nie [BOLD:polegali tylko na samej mocy].

"15756","You see, this is [BOLD:another custom 240SX] from the Formula Drift circuit. [BOLD:’95] this time, with [BOLD:only 830 horses]. So you'll have to prove this is as much about finesse as it is flat-out power.","","Oto [BOLD:kolejny zmodyfikowany model 240SX] spod znaku Formula Drift. Tym razem rocznik [BOLD:95] o mocy [BOLD:zaledwie 830 koni]. Udowodnij, że oprócz tego, co jest pod maską, liczy się również finezja."
"15757","I’ve [BOLD:laid in] as [BOLD:technical] a [BOLD:route] as I could find. The rest is up to you.","","[BOLD:Wytyczyłem] trasę wymagającą [BOLD:doskonałej techniki]. Reszta zależy już tylko od ciebie."
"15758","Well, there’s the proof. [BOLD:Power isn’t] the [BOLD:most important thing] in your [BOLD:drift setup]. Which isn’t to say we won’t still argue the point later on, you know, just for fun.","","Oto dowód. [BOLD:Moc nie jest] najważniejszą rzeczą w [BOLD:maszynie do driftu]. Oczywiście w przyszłości możemy się trochę na ten temat posprzeczać, no wiesz, tak dla zabawy."
"15759","Our [BOLD:Fortune Island headquarters plan] is [BOLD:on hold] for the moment. I wanted to get us back to what Drift Club does best. Arguing over the tiniest details of drift engineering.","","Plany przeniesienia naszej [BOLD:siedziby głównej na Fortune Island] muszą [BOLD:trochę poczekać]. Wróćmy do tego, co Drift Club robi najlepiej. Posprzeczajmy się o najdrobniejsze szczegóły w zakresie mechaniki driftowania."
"15760","Possibly a bad time to mention this, but [BOLD:I’ve never] actually [BOLD:seen a Formula Drift event] live! I’m [BOLD:just friends] with Andy and the other [BOLD:drivers through the internet]!","","To chyba nie najlepszy moment, aby o tym wspominać, ale jeszcze [BOLD:nigdy] nie widziałem [BOLD:zawodów Formula Drift na żywo]!

"15761","I’ve [BOLD:got just the machine] for you to do it in. The car that’s going to [BOLD:make Drift Club history].

[BOLD:Nic ekstrawaganckiego], to po prostu przyzwoita bryka, ale ma sekretną broń: ciebie za kółkiem."
"15762","I've [BOLD:got just the machine] for you to do it in. My friend [BOLD:Andy’s BMW 325I]. [BOLD:Standard Chevy-LS based engine], [BOLD:6.2 liter V8]. But it does have one massive advantage… you’re behind the wheel.","","Mam dla ciebie [BOLD:idealną maszynę] do tego zadania: [BOLD:BMW 325I] mojego znajomego [BOLD:Andy’ego].

"15763","Oh, one more thing. [BOLD:This route loops] around the [BOLD:entire island], so ah… I hope you visited the bathroom first!","","A, jeszcze jedno. [BOLD:Ta trasa] prowadzi [BOLD:wokół całej wyspy], tak więc… mam nadzieję, że masz za sobą wizytę w toalecie!"
"15764","Oh, one more thing. This route is the [BOLD:best route I could find] on the island. I do hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoy welding differentials.","","A, jeszcze jedno.

Oto [BOLD:nowa siedziba główna Drift Clubu]! Witaj na… [BOLD:Drift Island]!

"15766","This is it. I’ve [BOLD:spoken to the Festival] and to the authorities. If you can [BOLD:pull this off], we can [BOLD:make the island] our [BOLD:permanent headquarters].

"15772","Now I realise this might be the [BOLD:most out of the way part] of the [BOLD:most out of the way place] the Club’s [BOLD:ever visited], but… there’s a very good reason. Trust me.","","Zdaję sobie sprawę, że to być może [BOLD:najbardziej odludna] część [BOLD:najbardziej odludnego miejsca], w jakie do tej pory [BOLD:zawitał klub], ale jest ku temu dobry powód. Zaufaj mi."
"15773","When it comes to [BOLD:switchbacks], I say [BOLD:too many is never enough]. Like spare tires or chocolate bourbons.","","Moim zdaniem [BOLD:serpentyn nigdy za wiele], zupełnie jak zapasowych opon lub ciasteczek do herbaty."
"15774","[BOLD:Drift Club] are always [BOLD:on at me] for [BOLD:new locations]. This [BOLD:ought to quiet them] for a bit, don’t you think?","","Członkowie [BOLD:Drift Clubu] są wiecznie [BOLD:spragnieni nowych miejsc]. To powinno im [BOLD:na trochę wystarczyć], nie uważasz?"
"15775","There is the slight disadvantage that if [BOLD:you go over the edge] we’ll [BOLD:probably never see you again]. But that just adds to the fun, I say!","","Jest mała niedogodność. Jeśli [BOLD:spadniesz z krawędzi], to pewnie już [BOLD:nigdy się nie zobaczymy], ale to tylko dodaje wszystkiemu odrobiny pikanterii!"
"15776","[BOLD:Asphalt] would be [BOLD:better], of course, but [BOLD:dirt adds] that element of [BOLD:uncertainty].","","Oczywiście [BOLD:asfalt] byłby [BOLD:lepszy], ale [BOLD:szuter] wprowadza pewną dozę [BOLD:niepewności]."
"15777","[BOLD:Strong winds] along the coast. [BOLD:Might affect] your [BOLD:traction]. Let me know if you’d like to write something about that for the Drift Club newsletter.","","[BOLD:Silny wiatr] na wybrzeżu [BOLD:może wpływać] na [BOLD:przyczepność]. Daj mi znać, czy mam napisać na ten temat w newsletterze Drift Clubu."
"15778","Oh, I [BOLD:wonder if] anyone would mind us [BOLD:borrowing the castle] for [BOLD:Drift Club committee] meetings.","","[BOLD:Ciekawe], czy ktoś mógłby nam [BOLD:udostępnić ten zamek] na potrzeby zebrań [BOLD:komitetu Drift Clubu]."
"15779","Don’t worry, we’ve got shipments of [BOLD:new tires coming] into port [BOLD:twice a week]!","","Nie przejmuj się! [BOLD:Dwa razy w tygodniu] czeka na nas w porcie [BOLD:nowa dostawa opon]!"
"15780","Ah have a [BOLD:listen to that]! What you are hearing here is a lovely thing [BOLD:called reverberation]. What? You didn’t think I only knew about the technicalities of drifting did you?","","[BOLD:Posłuchaj tego]! Ten cudowny dźwięk to [BOLD:pogłos]. Coś nie tak? Nie sądzisz chyba, że jedyne, na czym się znam, to technikalia driftowania, co?"
"15781","Well [BOLD:hello again]! Fancy seeing you on Fortune Island! Actually I was well aware you’d be here, that’s a large part of why I’ve come. [BOLD:Shall we get started]?","","[BOLD:Witaj ponownie]! Dobrze cię widzieć na Fortune Island! Prawdę mówiąc i tak wiedziałem, że tu będziesz i właśnie dlatego postanowiłem przyjechać. [BOLD:To jak, zaczynamy]?"
"15782","For example, this [BOLD:claimant placed] a 2.6-liter [BOLD:rotory engine] inside of [BOLD:production Mazda Miata MX-5]. As you are aware, this type of [BOLD:engine] is more [BOLD:common] in, uh, [BOLD:high-performance propeller-driven aircraft].","","[BOLD:Ten powód], na przykład, [BOLD:umieścił] 2,6-litrowy [BOLD:silnik rotacyjny] w [BOLD:seryjnym pojeździe Mazda Miata MX-5].

"15783","If you would [BOLD:please] take it and [BOLD:ascertain] just [BOLD:how badly this can go wrong].","","[BOLD:Jeśli możesz], weź ten samochód i [BOLD:ustal, co może pójść nie tak]."
"15784","Well, I must say, whether the [BOLD:claim was proved or disproved], it was a [BOLD:great deal of fun], and I have [BOLD:you to thank]. I know you are busy at the Festival… I am sure I will see more of you… but [BOLD:if you should ever leave], I hope you will [BOLD:consider a career in insurance].","","Cóż, przyznam szczerze, że niezależnie od tego, co [BOLD:udowodniliśmy powodowi], było przy tym [BOLD:mnóstwo frajdy]. Wszystko [BOLD:dzięki tobie]. Wiem, że masz co robić na Festiwalu i na pewno jeszcze się spotkamy, ale [BOLD:gdyby nasze drogi się rozeszły], liczę na to, że [BOLD:rozważysz karierę w branży ubezpieczeniowej]."
"15785","So, the [BOLD:data] is [BOLD:adequate] but [BOLD:incomplete…] Please [BOLD:do not concern yourself] with the [BOLD:howling noise]. This is [BOLD:quite normal].

"15786","Ah, [BOLD:well done]. But I feel we would gain [BOLD:further illumination] with [BOLD:further acceleration], do you not think so?","","[BOLD:Dobra robota]. Czuję jednak, że [BOLD:doznalibyśmy olśnienia] przy [BOLD:większym przyspieszeniu], nie uważasz?"
"15787","Ah, interesting. My [BOLD:calculations suggest] a performance of this kind should result in [BOLD:total spontaneous engine disassembly] and [BOLD:yet… here you are]!","","Aha, ciekawe. Z moich [BOLD:obliczeń wynika], że taka eksploatacja powinna skutkować natychmiastowym, [BOLD:samoistnym demontażem silnika], a tu jednak… [BOLD:nic ci nie jest]!"
"15788","The [BOLD:first phase] of testing will be along [BOLD:standard country roads], with mild undulations, next to the coast.","","[BOLD:Pierwszą fazę testów] przeprowadzimy na [BOLD:typowych drogach gruntowych] o pofałdowaniu charakterystycznym dla terenów przybrzeżnych."
"15789","Good. Now for the [BOLD:urban testing phase]. You will please take into account traffic and various asphalt conditions. Please [BOLD:avoid collisions with urban vehicles].","","Dobrze. Teraz [BOLD:faza testów miejskich]. Uwzględnij, z łaski swojej, ruch uliczny i zmieniającą się jakość nawierzchni. [BOLD:Unikaj też kolizji] z innymi uczestnikami ruchu."
"15790","Excellent. Now we begin the [BOLD:highway testing phase]. Please [BOLD:exceed 200 hundred miles an hour] along this section for [BOLD:optimum data gathering].","","Doskonale. Teraz przejdziemy do [BOLD:fazy testów na autostradzie]. Przekrocz, proszę, [BOLD:320 km/h] na tym odcinku, byśmy mieli szansę [BOLD:zebrać optymalne dane]."
"15791","Hah, I am afraid [BOLD:this case represents our last] together [BOLD:as colleagues] and[BOLD: work-related social companions]. For the moment! As long as [BOLD:there is insurance], my friend, there [BOLD:will be bizarre insurance claims].","","Cóż, obawiam się, że ta [BOLD:sprawa będzie naszym ostatnim] wspólnym przedsięwzięciem w roli [BOLD:kolegów i współpracowników]. Przynajmniej na tę chwilę! [BOLD:Przedziwne roszczenia] będą się pojawiać notorycznie, [BOLD:dopóki istnieją ubezpieczenia]."
"15792","Now, the [BOLD:claimant] in our [BOLD:first case] poses an interesting [BOLD:question] around [BOLD:acceleration] and [BOLD:downforce]. Now, if you would kindly [BOLD:take this Volkswagen Type 2] and attempt to [BOLD:make it take off].","","[BOLD:Powód] w naszej [BOLD:pierwszej sprawie] stawia ciekawe [BOLD:pytanie] dotyczące [BOLD:przyspieszenia] i [BOLD:siły docisku]. Weź, z łaski swojej, tego [BOLD:Volkswagena T2] i spróbuj zmusić go do [BOLD:oderwania się od ziemi]."
"15793","I assure you this is, uh, [BOLD:theoretically possible], given [BOLD:sufficient speed]. I have set your navigation.","","Zapewniam cię, że jest to, eee, [BOLD:teoretycznie możliwe] przy [BOLD:odpowiedniej prędkości]. Ustawiłem ci nawigację."
"15794","And so, the [BOLD:claim is disproved]. The Volkswagen Type 2 [BOLD:cannot fly]… But, to be truthful, I am [BOLD:not surprised] by the results of this experiment [BOLD:but] you will learn [BOLD:I am nothing if not thorough].","","Roszczenie jest zatem [BOLD:bezpodstawne]. Volkswagen T2 [BOLD:nie potrafi latać]… Mówiąc szczerze, wynik tego eksperymentu wcale mnie [BOLD:nie dziwi]. Wiedz jednak, że uchodzę za człowieka [BOLD:sumiennego]."
"15795","The test was [BOLD:unsuccessful], but [BOLD:no matter]. Failure is a great teacher.","","Test zakończył się [BOLD:niepowodzeniem], ale to [BOLD:bez znaczenia]. Porażka jest doskonałym nauczycielem."
"15796","In Germany we would call [BOLD:this test kaput]. Let us [BOLD:reset] and [BOLD:try again].","","W Niemczech powiedzielibyśmy, że [BOLD:test jest kaputt]. [BOLD:Zresetujmy] go i [BOLD:spróbujmy jeszcze raz]."
"15797","In any case, we learn an [BOLD:important lesson] about [BOLD:driver error], before we [BOLD:try again, yes]?","","Cokolwiek by było, odebraliśmy [BOLD:ważną naukę] o [BOLD:błędach kierowcy]. Teraz możemy [BOLD:spróbować jeszcze raz], czyż nie?"
"15798","So, [BOLD:you] are the one [BOLD:Joel] has [BOLD:sent to help me], yes? Ha. Ah, [BOLD:my name] is [BOLD:Hans Liebold]. For thirty years [BOLD:I designed] and [BOLD:built] performance [BOLD:vehicles] in [BOLD:Germany] but [BOLD:I have come] to the [BOLD:Festival] to [BOLD:pursue] a more [BOLD:exciting vocation… insurance].

Huh, no matter, [BOLD:let us begin].","","Czyli to [BOLD:ciebie Joel] przydzielił mi do [BOLD:pomocy], tak? Aha. Nazywam się [BOLD:Hans Liebold]. Przez trzydzieści lat [BOLD:projektowałem] i [BOLD:budowałem] w [BOLD:Niemczech] wyczynowe [BOLD:pojazdy], ale przybyłem na [BOLD:festiwal] w poszukiwaniu [BOLD:ciekawszego powołania] — [BOLD:ubezpieczeń]. Hmm… to był [BOLD:żart]. Chciałem cię trochę rozluźnić. Chyba mi się [BOLD:nie udało]. Cóż, nieistotne. [BOLD:Zaczynajmy]."
"15799","Hah, yes! [BOLD:I have seen] the Type 2 achieve [BOLD:such speeds] once before but [BOLD:only when dropped] from an [BOLD:aeroplane].","","Ha, tak jest! Kiedyś [BOLD:widziałem], jak T2 rozwija [BOLD:taką prędkość], ale trzeba go było [BOLD:zrzucić z samolotu]."
"15800","Ah. It appears I have [BOLD:forgotten to close the roads] to traffic. But we must [BOLD:reproduce conditions] as closely as possible, [BOLD:yes?]","","Zdaje się, że [BOLD:zapomniałem zamknąć drogi] dla ruchu. Musimy się jednak postarać możliwie wiernie [BOLD:odtworzyć warunki], czyż nie?"
"15801","Now, this is [BOLD:the BMW Isetta]. For its size it is [BOLD:deceptively powerful] and also [BOLD:highly maneuverable]. Though I think perhaps [BOLD:not so maneuverable] for the [BOLD:claimant] who delivered theirs into the back of a furniture truck.","","Oto [BOLD:BMW Isetta]. Jest [BOLD:zaskakująco mocna] jak na swoje rozmiary, a do tego [BOLD:wyjątkowo zwrotna]. Aczkolwiek [BOLD:nie na tyle zwrotna], by powodowi udało się ominąć ciężarówkę z meblami."
"15802","So, if you would [BOLD:please test] the Isetta’s [BOLD:ability to navigate traffic ]whilst [BOLD:avoiding collisions]. For the experiment and for your own safety, of course.","","Jeśli możesz, [BOLD:prosiłbym cię] o sprawdzenie, jak Isetta [BOLD:radzi sobie w ruchu ulicznym]. [BOLD:Unikaj] wszelkich [BOLD:kolizji]. W ten sposób dostarczysz dane potrzebne do eksperymentu, no i pożyjesz dłużej."
"15803","And so [BOLD:the claim is disproved]! With sufficient driver application, the [BOLD:BMW Isetta may navigate even dense traffic]. I will inform [BOLD:the claimant] that they[BOLD: must simply try harder].","","Roszczenie uznaję za [BOLD:bezpodstawne]! Przy odpowiednim udziale kierowcy BMW, Isetta [BOLD:jest w stanie przemieszczać się nawet w gęstym ruchu ulicznym]. Poinformuję [BOLD:powoda], że musi się na przyszłość [BOLD:bardziej postarać]."
"15804","[BOLD:Hello!] I am [BOLD:pleased to see you] again. Not merely for professional purposes but also [BOLD:because of our developing social connection].","","[BOLD:Witaj!] Miło mi cię [BOLD:znowu widzieć]. Nie tylko ze względów zawodowych, ale też z uwagi na [BOLD:zacieśniającą się między nami komitywę]."
"15805","Hm. This is a [BOLD:good baseline], but I think you can [BOLD:provide me with more data], yes?","","Hm, mamy już [BOLD:solidne podstawy], ale czy zdołasz [BOLD:zgromadzić nieco więcej danych], hm?"
"15806","[BOLD:Good], good. Uh, still, there are [BOLD:more variables we can test], if you are willing?","","[BOLD:Dobrze], aczkolwiek moglibyśmy jeszcze zbadać [BOLD:kilka zmiennych], jeśli masz chęć."
"15807","Excellent. [BOLD:I have all the data I need]. Thank you.","","Doskonale. Mam [BOLD:wszystkie niezbędne dane]. Dziękuję."
"15808","[BOLD:With some small stability enhancements ]this design, in my opinion, is [BOLD:quite sound].","","Po kilku [BOLD:usprawnieniach dotyczących stabilności], konstrukcja jest, moim zdaniem, [BOLD:dość solidna]."
"15809","You will [BOLD:proceed], please, [BOLD:to Bamburgh Castle], where we will [BOLD:attempt] a small and[BOLD: highly scientific jump].","","[BOLD:Pojedziesz], jeśli łaska, do [BOLD:zamku Bamburgh] i [BOLD:spróbujesz] wykonać nieduży, lecz [BOLD:istotny z punktu widzenia nauki skok]."
"15810","Good, good. Now, to [BOLD:recreate the conditions of the accident], which resulted in a [BOLD:claim for damages] to a [BOLD:church roof].","","Dobrze. Spróbujemy teraz [BOLD:zrekonstruować wypadek], który skończył się [BOLD:wnioskiem o odszkodowanie] za uszkodzenie [BOLD:dachu kościoła]."
"15811","[BOLD:Our next case] involves [BOLD:an outlandish claim] and [BOLD:a vehicle] with something of a [BOLD:reputation] here in [BOLD:Britain], which I believe to be [BOLD:undeserved]. You know this, [BOLD:the… Reliant Supervan]?","","Nasza [BOLD:następna sprawa] wiąże się z [BOLD:niedorzecznym roszczeniem] i [BOLD:pojazdem] cieszącym się w [BOLD:Brytanii] nie najlepszą [BOLD:reputacją], moim zdaniem [BOLD:niezasłużenie.] Chodzi o [BOLD:Relianta Supervana], więc chyba wiesz, o czym mowa."
"15812","Ha, you see! My [BOLD:enhancements greatly improve stability ]with [BOLD:no detriment] to the [BOLD:look of the car]… If anything [BOLD:a small improvement], I think.","","A widzisz?

"15813","[BOLD:For this next test] I have compensated. [BOLD:Perhaps overcompensated]. Hah. We shall see.","","Na potrzeby [BOLD:następnego testu] zaradziłem tym brakom. Być może [BOLD:nawet z nawiązką]. Cóż, zobaczymy."
"15814","Hmm. It occurs to me that I have [BOLD:added no additional safety features] but [BOLD:at least ]you will be [BOLD:landing on sand].","","Hm. Najwyraźniej zapomniałem pomyśleć o [BOLD:dodatkowych środkach bezpieczeństwa]. Ale [BOLD:przynajmniej] tu akurat [BOLD:lądujesz na piasku]."
"15815","And so we see that it is entirely [BOLD:possible] to [BOLD:deposit a Reliant Supervan] in the [BOLD:belfry] of a [BOLD:country church]. I will [BOLD:contact the claimant ]and [BOLD:pass on] the [BOLD:good news]… Well, [BOLD:the results] anyway.","","I tak oto widzimy, że [BOLD:Reliant Supervan] zdecydowanie [BOLD:możne zostać zaparkowany na dzwonnicy] wiejskiego kościółka. [BOLD:Skontaktuję się z powodem] i przekażę mu [BOLD:dobre wieści]… a właściwie [BOLD:wyniki]."
"15816","You see, the [BOLD:fiberglass construction] makes the Reliant Supervan [BOLD:light enough] to [BOLD:become airborne]. It [BOLD:lacks], I think, in [BOLD:aerodynamics] and [BOLD:engine power].","","Zrozum, że konstrukcja z [BOLD:włókna szklanego] zapewniła konstrukcji Relianta Supervana taką [BOLD:lekkość], że pojazd mógłby się [BOLD:wzbić w powietrze].

"15817","It worked! I mean… [BOLD:of course it worked.]","","Udało się! Znaczy… [BOLD:oczywiście, że się udało]."
"15818","Now, one of my [BOLD:claimants] has apparently [BOLD:tried] to [BOLD:recreate scenes of the film], which [BOLD:features a Morris Minor] similar to this one.

"15819","We will [BOLD:require city conditions] and traffic lights, so, [BOLD:Edinburgh] if you [BOLD:please].","","Będziemy musieli odtworzyć [BOLD:warunki ruchu miejskiego] i sygnalizację świetlną. Udaj się więc do [BOLD:Edynburga], jeśli możesz."
"15820","Well done.

"15821","Do you know that in my spare time [BOLD:I am an avid watcher of films]? Oh, yes.

"15822","[BOLD:Edinburgh] is [BOLD:not much like] the [BOLD:California] of the film but [BOLD:perhaps] we can [BOLD:use our imaginations].","","[BOLD:Edynburg] znacznie [BOLD:różni się] od przedstawionej w filmie [BOLD:Kalifornii], ale może uda się temu zaradzić z pomocą [BOLD:wyobraźni]."
"15823","This is [BOLD:not] strictly [BOLD:reproducing] conditions of the [BOLD:film], but nor is the Speed Trap we are borrowing from the Horizon Festival.","","Nie jest to [BOLD:wierna rekonstrukcja] wydarzeń z filmu, ale nikt wtedy nie miał fotoradaru, który wypożyczyliśmy z festiwalu Horizon."
"15824","Now, [BOLD:straight-line speed] is our object… If it helps, [BOLD:you may imagine] you are [BOLD:racing against] an [BOLD:impossibly handsome actor].","","Naszym celem jest [BOLD:prędkość w linii prostej]… Jeśli ci to pomoże, [BOLD:wyobraź sobie], że [BOLD:ścigasz się z nieprzyzwoicie przystojnym aktorem]."
"15825","Excellent! I will [BOLD:advise the claimant] that they may be [BOLD:confident lining up against] an [BOLD:Austin-Healey Sprite], as in the film… [BOLD:Once] their[BOLD: Morris Minor returns] from the [BOLD:crash repairer], of course.","","Doskonale! [BOLD:Poinformuję powoda], że może [BOLD:śmiało stawać] przeciwko [BOLD:Austinowi-Healeyowi Sprite'owi] — tak jak w filmie. Oczywiście kiedy jego [BOLD:Morris Minor wróci od blacharza]."
"15826","Now, we must [BOLD:test the drag race performance] of the Morris Minor… with a [BOLD:few small engine modifications] of my own.","","Musimy sprawdzić, co Morris Minor potrafi w [BOLD:wyścigu równoległym]… Oczywiście po kilku [BOLD:autorskich modyfikacjach] silnika."
"15827","Though I was [BOLD:not disappointed] with the [BOLD:result].

"15829","I must confess [BOLD:I was confused] by our next [BOLD:case] involving a [BOLD:“racing truck.” ]I was not aware of such a term.

"15858","Now, this is a [BOLD:1966 Volkswagen Beetle] into which I have [BOLD:placed a 2.5-liter F4 Turbo engine], partly to [BOLD:replicate] the conditions of [BOLD:the claim] but [BOLD:also because] I would very much [BOLD:like to see what happens].","","Oto [BOLD:Volkswagen Garbus z 1966 roku], w którym zamontowałem [BOLD:2,5-litrowy silnik bokser z turbodoładowaniem].

"16436","Lovely little [BOLD:seaside retreat]. You’d have [BOLD:direct access to the beach] but, [BOLD:if] you go [BOLD:swimming], just [BOLD:be careful], yeah? You [BOLD:wouldn’t be the first] driver I’ve [BOLD:had to fish out] of [BOLD:the sea]. Or [BOLD:a lake]. Or [BOLD:a public fountain]… once.","","Piękny, mały, [BOLD:nadmorski domek].

"16438","So, the [BOLD:other day] I’m [BOLD:searching the woods] here, [BOLD:driver] with a [BOLD:busted satnav], don’t ask, and [BOLD:I see something] through the trees. I pull off the road, [BOLD:down a gravel path], and find… [BOLD:this]. Turns out the [BOLD:owner’s looking to sell].","","No więc wyglądało to tak, że pewnego dnia [BOLD:przeszukiwałem las] – zepsuta [BOLD:nawigacja] u jednego z [BOLD:kierowców], nawet nie pytaj – i zobaczyłem coś między drzewami.

"16439","Apparently, there are big [BOLD:Edinburgh events coming] up, so I thought [BOLD:you could use] a [BOLD:place in] the [BOLD:suburbs]. It’s [BOLD:not cheap], but come on.

Może [BOLD:nie jest tani], ale to w końcu jedno z [BOLD:najpiękniejszych miast w Wielkiej Brytanii]. Zdaniem Aleksa, to i nawet [BOLD:na całym świecie]."

"16441","Here we go, [BOLD:house and grounds] with [BOLD:private road] access.

"16453","This is why [BOLD:I like you], you’re [BOLD:a driver who gives back] to the local business community. The fact that [BOLD:you’ve also maxed out] your [BOLD:income] from that particular local business is just a coincidence, I’m sure.","","Właśnie dlatego cię [BOLD:lubię]: jesteś [BOLD:kierowcą, który wspiera] lokalne firmy. A to, że udało ci się [BOLD:zmaksymalizować przychody] z tej konkretnej firmy, to czysty przypadek. Jestem tego pewien."
"16454","[BOLD:Nice work] out there. The [BOLD:more stars] you earn, the [BOLD:higher] your [BOLD:business payout]. Simple, right?","","[BOLD:Niezła robota]. Im [BOLD:więcej gwiazdek] uzyskasz, tym [BOLD:wyższe] będą twoje [BOLD:zarobki]. Łatwizna, prawda?"

"16820","We [BOLD:went back and forth] on this last showcase. [BOLD:Couldn’t decide] if we should [BOLD:race by land], by [BOLD:sea]. So, [BOLD:we] sort of [BOLD:split the difference]. Shouldn’t be a problem for you though, right? Course not. [BOLD:See you there].","","Mieliśmy [BOLD:niezły zgryz] z tym najnowszym pokazem, bo nie [BOLD:mogliśmy się zdecydować], czy trasa powinna prowadzić [BOLD:przez ląd], czy [BOLD:przez morze]. Ostatecznie ją tak jakby [BOLD:uśredniliśmy]… ale dla ciebie to chyba nie problem? Tak sądziłam! [BOLD:Widzimy się na miejscu]!"
"16821","Hey, [BOLD:we knew] this thing would [BOLD:be tough], that’s why it’s here. Let me know when [BOLD:you want] it to [BOLD:circle back].","","Spokojnie, [BOLD:wiedzieliśmy], że będzie [BOLD:trudno]. Łatwe znaczy nudne! Daj znać, [BOLD:kiedy ma zawrócić]."
"16822","We’ve got a [BOLD:new Showcase] coming up, racing against a [BOLD:huge hovercraft], although I’m wondering which driver to pick.

Wciąż jeszcze nie wiem, którego kierowcę wybrać… pokaż coś wyjątkowego, a [BOLD:może dam ci pojechać]."
"16823","I know [BOLD:it’s big], and I know it [BOLD:looks slow], but it [BOLD:can go places you can’t]. Just [BOLD:keep] your [BOLD:foot down], yeah? We have a lot riding on this.","","Wiem, że jest [BOLD:ogromny] i [BOLD:wygląda na powolny], ale przejedzie [BOLD:tam, gdzie samochód nie może]. Sporo od tego wyścigu zależy, więc [BOLD:gaz do dechy] i nie odpuszczaj!"
"16824","[BOLD:Nice]! Four wheels beats two fans and a big air mattress any day of the week. I [BOLD:never doubted you] for a second.","","[BOLD:Pięknie]! Dwa wiatraki i dmuchany materac nie pobiją solidnych czterech kółek. [BOLD:Ani przez chwilę] w ciebie nie wątpiłam."
"16825","Great news, I’ve [BOLD:found] a [BOLD:driver for] our first [BOLD:Showcase event]. A rookie, no less. Unproven but [BOLD:highly skilled], [BOLD:huge potential].

Początkującego i niesprawdzonego w zawodach, ale zanosi się na [BOLD:wielki talent]. Na pewno postara się, by wszyscy zapamiętali ten wyścig na długo. No to jak, [BOLD:masz wolną chwilę]?"
"16826","[BOLD:Don’t worry], just shake it off and [BOLD:concentrate on qualifying] for [BOLD:next season]. Who knows?

"16836","[BOLD:Welcome] to [BOLD:spring]! I’m this [BOLD:close to] putting you on the [BOLD:Horizon roster] but I feel like I might [BOLD:require] a tiny bit [BOLD:more convincing].

Tak się składa, że zbliża się ogromny [BOLD:wiosenny pokaz], więc skoro w przeszłości nie miałam już po pokazach żadnych wątpliwości co do ciebie, to może powtórzysz tę sztuczkę, a ja w końcu dam się przekonać… [BOLD:Jasne jak słońce]?"
"16839","Now, I must have [BOLD:done something wrong] because I’m still [BOLD:not seeing you on] the Horizon [BOLD:roster].

"16840","I’m [BOLD:pulling together data] as we speak, figuring out how to [BOLD:assign] Horizon [BOLD:roster spots]. Let me worry about working on the numbers.

"16841","So, [BOLD:how are you on] the [BOLD:dirt]? Pretty good, right? I’ve seen you drive. Are you [BOLD:better than], let’s say… a [BOLD:dirt bike]? OK, but are you [BOLD:better than four] dirt bikes?","","No dobra, a [BOLD:jak sobie radzisz] na [BOLD:szutrze]? Nieźle, prawda? Widziałam, jak jeździsz. A potrafisz [BOLD:pojechać lepiej], niż na przykład… [BOLD:motocykl crossowy]? A [BOLD:lepiej, niż cztery] motocykle crossowe?"
"16842","That was [BOLD:amazing]! I have a team of slightly [BOLD:bewildered Motocross riders] who all [BOLD:want] a turn behind the wheel of [BOLD:your car] now.

"16848","[BOLD:So much for] the [BOLD:Flying Scotsman]. We might [BOLD:have to start] up the [BOLD:Horizon Line]!

"16849","Better hurry. You’ve [BOLD:got] a [BOLD:train to catch].","","Lepiej się pospiesz, bo ci [BOLD:pociąg ucieknie]."
"16850","You know, when they said “[BOLD:The Flying Scotsman]” I was [BOLD:expecting] to see [BOLD:Alex] being [BOLD:shot out of cannon]. I suppose this’ll do instead.","","Jak powiedzieli [BOLD:Latający Szkot], to myślałam, że jakiś [BOLD:prawdziwy Szkot] będzie fruwać – na przykład [BOLD:Alex]… Ale z pociągiem też będzie zabawa."
"16851","I might not have another train laying around, but I certainly have some [BOLD:events for spring] you might be [BOLD:interested in].

It’ll get you warmed up.","","Dobra, [BOLD:zamknęliśmy kilka przybrzeżnych dróg]. Nie mogę ci jeszcze dać wozu kaskaderskiego. Jak go zobaczysz, to zrozumiesz.

"20615","[BOLD:Here we are]. I’ll do the final briefing and then you’re on.","","[BOLD:Jesteśmy na miejscu]. Wydam ostatnie instrukcje, a potem twoja kolej."
"20616","Look who it is. [BOLD:Ready] to get stuck [BOLD:back in]? Bet you are. Don’t get carried away, though.","","Kogo my tu mamy? [BOLD:Nie masz jeszcze dość]? No raczej. Tylko nie daj się ponieść."

"20619","Here we go… [BOLD:Scene 29]. [BOLD:Beauty drive]. ACTION!","","Jedziemy… [BOLD:Scena 29]. [BOLD:Piękna jazda]. AKCJA!"
"20620","That was [BOLD:beautiful]… Uhh, the shot I mean. [BOLD:The car] and [BOLD:the setting] and [BOLD:the whole effect]. Your driving was half-decent too.","","To było [BOLD:piękne]… Znaczy ujęcie. [BOLD:Samochód], [BOLD:otoczenie] i [BOLD:ogólny efekt]. Twoja jazda też była w miarę przyzwoita."
"20621","[BOLD:No jets or jumps] this time, [BOLD:just] a beautiful [BOLD:high-speed drive] along the [BOLD:coast road]. Apparently, it’s all the same movie, and Frankie’s not in in this bit, so [BOLD:keep that helmet on].","","Tym razem [BOLD:bez odrzutowców i skoków], tylko piękna [BOLD:szybka jazda przybrzeżną trasą]. Podobno to ten sam film a Frankiego nie ma w tej scenie, więc [BOLD:nie zdejmuj kasku]."
"20622","[BOLD:No jets or jumps] this time, [BOLD:just] a beautiful [BOLD:high-speed drive] along the [BOLD:coast road]. [BOLD:Apparently], it’s all the [BOLD:same movie]. I wouldn’t know… I [BOLD:haven’t read] the [BOLD:script].","","Tym razem [BOLD:bez odrzutowców i skoków], tylko [BOLD:piękna szybka przejażdżka] wzdłuż brzegu.

"20633","It’s [BOLD:another jump]. Still the [BOLD:same movie], somehow.

Najwyraźniej wciąż [BOLD:ten sam film]. Podobno [BOLD:próbowali] to zrobić [BOLD:komputerowo] i [BOLD:wyglądało do niczego], więc [BOLD:ty zrobisz to na żywo]."
"20634","Right. [BOLD:This] is [BOLD:the place]. This is a tricky one. A [BOLD:jump] across a [BOLD:river]. Loads of rocks. Focus. [BOLD:Get] the car [BOLD:to speed].","","OK.

"20636","When car jumps go wrong, they hurt. Trust me. But we’ve [BOLD:stiffened the suspension] and there’s a [BOLD:solid five point in there]. We’ve done all we can for you.

"20639","[BOLD:Forget] about the [BOLD:river], forget about the [BOLD:rocks]. You just [BOLD:worry about] your [BOLD:speed and the ramp].

[BOLD:Skup się] tylko [BOLD:na prędkości i rampie]. Na moje oko potrzeba ci [BOLD:przynajmniej sto sześćdziesiąt km/h], żeby przeskoczyć."

"20646","OK… [BOLD:Scene 82]. [BOLD:Village chase]. ACTION!","","OK… [BOLD:Scena 82], [BOLD:pościg w wiosce]. AKCJA!"
"20647","[BOLD:Nice work]. [BOLD:I’ll get this] footage straight [BOLD:into editing] so the rushes can go to the director.

[BOLD:Oddam] ten materiał od razu [BOLD:montażystom], żeby kopie robocze trafiły do reżysera. Heh, nawet jeśli nic z tego nie zostanie użyte… to z pewnością [BOLD:wieś dostała od ciebie nauczkę]."
"20648","Right, so they [BOLD:couldn’t convince Frankie] to really cut loose with some [BOLD:dangerous driving]. Said it “wasn’t right for the character.” Tch. Actors.

"20649","More, give us [BOLD:more]! We want you to [BOLD:really wreck the place]!","","Więcej, [BOLD:dawaj więcej]! Rozwal wszystko [BOLD:w drobny mak]!"
"20650","More, give us [BOLD:more]! We want you to [BOLD:really wreck the place]! I just [BOLD:read the script], though.

Rozwal wszystko [BOLD:w drobny mak]! [BOLD:Przeczytałem] właśnie [BOLD:scenariusz]. Podobno ''[BOLD:szczątki spadają na całą wioskę]''. Wow. [BOLD:O czym ten film w ogóle jest]?"
"20651","Great! [BOLD:No idea] what the [BOLD:point of this scene] is, by the way, so [BOLD:just have fun]!","","Świetnie! [BOLD:Nie mam pojęcia], o [BOLD:co chodzi w tej scenie], więc [BOLD:baw się dobrze]!"
"20652","Hah, [BOLD:fantastic]! Real [BOLD:cinematic brilliance], right there!","","Ha, [BOLD:fantastycznie]! Prawdziwe [BOLD:piękno kina]!"
"20653","Great. Anyway, [BOLD:it’s] all set up on a [BOLD:road course]. Bit of a drive, so you may as well [BOLD:take] the [BOLD:stunt vehicle].

"20654","[BOLD:Location] is up in [BOLD:the mountains]. I’ll see you there.","","[BOLD:Plener] jest [BOLD:w górach]. Do zobaczenia na miejscu."

"20656","Hello again. So, uh, I [BOLD:spoke with] the [BOLD:director] of this Frankie Beaumont movie, and, uh… I think [BOLD:they’re writing] in new [BOLD:stunts] just [BOLD:for you] now… If you’re up for it.

"20657","Supposedly [BOLD:you’re] up in the mountains [BOLD:formulating] your [BOLD:evil plan] or something. I wouldn’t worry about it.

"20658","We good? Right… [BOLD:Scene 14A]. [BOLD:Downhill rush]! ACTION!","","Wszystko gra? Dobra… [BOLD:Scena 14A], [BOLD:zjazd z góry]! AKCJA!"
"20659","Good. [BOLD:Real good]. Who knows how it fits into the story but I reckon this [BOLD:movie’s got] a properly [BOLD:diabolical villain now]… what do you reckon?","","Niezłe. [BOLD:Naprawdę niezłe]. Kto tam wie, jak to się ma do fabuły, ale przynajmniej w filmie [BOLD:złoczyńca jest teraz naprawdę zły]... A ty jak sądzisz?"
"20660","Oh, I should mention, [BOLD:you’re] doubling for [BOLD:the villain] this time. Everyone loves a good bad guy, right?","","A, powinienem ci jeszcze powiedzieć, że tym razem [BOLD:dublujesz tego złego]. Nie ma to jak dobry szwarccharakter, co nie?"
"20661","[BOLD:Take it offroad]! Watch the cliffs! Some [BOLD:big air coming] up!","","[BOLD:Zjedź z drogi]! Uważaj na klify! [BOLD:Zaraz będzie hopa]!"
"20662","How’s that for scenery? Now we’ve got [BOLD:cameras on] the [BOLD:viaduct], so [BOLD:keep control] as you come [BOLD:down this slope]!","","To dopiero sceneria, nie? [BOLD:Kamery] skierowane [BOLD:na wiadukt], więc [BOLD:zachowaj kontrolę], zjeżdżając [BOLD:z tego zbocza]!"
"20663","That [BOLD:house is] your… [BOLD:secret base]. I dunno, just [BOLD:drive] it [BOLD:like a bad guy]. You’re doing great!","","[BOLD:Ten dom] to twoja… [BOLD:tajna baza]. Sam nie wiem, po prostu [BOLD:jedź jak czarny charakter] — świetnie ci idzie!"
"20664","[BOLD:Take the car]. Get a feel for it. Not bad!","","[BOLD:Weź auto]. Oswój się z nim. Nieźle!"
"20665","[BOLD:Race you] there? … Hah, n-no… [BOLD:kidding]. I’m too old for that.","","[BOLD:Ścigamy się]? Ha, nie no, co ty, [BOLD:żartowałem]. Za stary na to jestem."
"20666","You see much [BOLD:arthouse cinema]? … Bit of a [BOLD:passion of mine], believe it or not.","","Oglądasz dużo [BOLD:kina niezależnego]? Przyznam ci się, że to trochę [BOLD:taka moja pasja]."
"20667","Are you familiar with Claude Lelouch’s “[BOLD:C’était un rendez-vous]”? … Look, I’m not usually much for arthouse cinema but this is the most [BOLD:famous eight-minute-run through Paris] ever put on film.","","Znasz ''[BOLD:C’était un rendez-vous]'' Claude'a Leloucha? Nie oglądam za bardzo kina niezależnego, ale to [BOLD:najsłynniejszy ośmiominutowy przejazd przez Paryż], jaki kiedykolwiek uchwycono na taśmie filmowej."
"20668","I’m [BOLD:doing] an [BOLD:homage], except I’m [BOLD:using] the [BOLD:most beautiful] of all the [BOLD:capitals of Europe]. What do you think?","","Mam zamiar złożyć temu dziełu [BOLD:hołd filmowy], z tym, że użyję [BOLD:najpiękniejszej stolicy Europy]. Co myślisz?"
"20669","Heyyy, [BOLD:there you are]. Taking a break from the Frankie Beaumont movie, if that’s alright. Thought you might [BOLD:help me with] a short [BOLD:film project] of my own. Up [BOLD:in Edinburgh].","","Heeej, [BOLD:tutaj jesteś]. Zróbmy sobie przerwę od filmu z Frankiem Beaumontem, jeśli nie masz nic przeciwko.

"20670","In this. Bit of a [BOLD:French reference], but [BOLD:it’s got] more than [BOLD:enough power]. [BOLD:Fast and clean] is what we’re going for.","","W tym. To małe [BOLD:odniesienie do Francji], ale [BOLD:mocy mu nie brakuje]. Ma być [BOLD:szybko i precyzyjnie]."
"20671","Right… “[BOLD:Edinburgh Rendezvous],” directed [BOLD:by Mike Steele]! ACTION!","","OK… ''[BOLD:Rendezvous w Edynburgu]'', reżyseria: [BOLD:Mike Steele]! AKCJA!"
"20672","Ohhh, oh, that was [BOLD:amazing]. Better than I imagined. [BOLD:I’ll invite you] to the [BOLD:premiere], kid, but don’t tell anyone you were the driver, yeah? We’ll, uh, keep it a mystery forever.","","Oooo, to było [BOLD:niesamowite]. Lepsze niż sobie wyobrażałem. [BOLD:Zaproszę cię na premierę], świeżak, tylko nie mów nikomu, kto siedział za kółkiem, dobra? Zachowamy to w tajemnicy aż po grób."
"20673","Right, [BOLD:route is set], got cameras on the car. All I want you to do is [BOLD:open it up]…","","OK, [BOLD:trasa ustawiona], kamery na samochodzie. Musisz już tylko [BOLD:dać po garach]…"
"20674","Hey! That’s [BOLD:not the route]! Oh, [BOLD:never mind]! Drive. DRIVE!","","Hej! To [BOLD:nie ta trasa]! Aj, [BOLD:nieważne]! Jedź. JEDŹ!"
"20675","Now, [BOLD:floor it] right [BOLD:down] the [BOLD:Royal Mile]!","","A teraz [BOLD:gazu na Royal Mile]!"
"20676","[BOLD:Across North Bridge], then hard [BOLD:right] and [BOLD:into New Town]!","","[BOLD:Przez Most Północny], potem ostro [BOLD:w prawo na Nowe Miasto]!"
"20677","Back [BOLD:up Princes Street] and [BOLD:along] the [BOLD:Gardens]. Come on, really [BOLD:go for it]!","","Wycofaj [BOLD:przez Princes Street] i [BOLD:wzdłuż ogrodów]. Daj z siebie [BOLD:wszystko]!"
"20678","Now [BOLD:out of the city]! … Without hitting a tram, please!","","A teraz [BOLD:wyjazd z miasta]! Tylko błagam, bez zderzenia z tramwajem!"
"20679","[BOLD:Hard left] here, kid! Watch for cars!","","Świeżak, [BOLD:ostry zakręt w lewo]! Uważaj na auta!"

"20682","But, uh, well, I didn’t tell them about you and [BOLD:Joel smoothed the whole thing over], so… Huhhh, let’s get [BOLD:back to] the [BOLD:movie] project, shall we?

Jedź [BOLD:tą furą] do [BOLD:południowego tunelu autostrady]."
"20683","[BOLD:Stunt unit] is [BOLD:standing by]. I’ll be down shortly.","","[BOLD:Ekipa kaskaderska czeka]. Niedługo będę."
"20684","Here we are. This is a [BOLD:pretty complicated setup]. The guys have been working round the clock… Aw, I know [BOLD:you can handle it], I’m just saying.","","Jesteśmy na miejscu. To dosyć [BOLD:skomplikowana scena] — chłopaki pracowali dzień i noc… No wiem, że [BOLD:dasz sobie radę], tak tylko mówię."
"20685","Hey. Uh, [BOLD:apparently], my little Edinburgh [BOLD:short film caused a stir]. It seems the [BOLD:city] doesn’t appreciate cinéma vérité.

Zdaje się, że [BOLD:miasto] nie docenia cinéma vérité — [BOLD:woleliby], żebyśmy [BOLD:mieli zezwolenie]."
"20686","Oh, and [BOLD:it’s] still the [BOLD:same] Frankie Beaumont [BOLD:movie]. [BOLD:No idea how] they [BOLD:worked] these [BOLD:new scenes into] the [BOLD:script].

Jak tak dalej pójdzie, to może nawet przyjdzie mi ochota go przeczytać."
"20687","If the driving’s real, nothing else matters.","","Jeśli jazda jest autentyczna, nic innego się nie liczy."
"20688","Righto… [BOLD:Scene 79A]. [BOLD:Barricade smash]! ACTION!","","No to ciach… [BOLD:Scena 79A], [BOLD:rozwalanie barykady]! AKCJA!"
"20689","Nice. Even if this [BOLD:movie doesn’t make] much [BOLD:sense] I reckon [BOLD:people] will [BOLD:see it] just [BOLD:for your driving]… Maybe that’s what they’re counting on.","","Nieźle. Nawet jeśli ten [BOLD:film nie będzie miał sensu], myślę, że [BOLD:ludzie będą go oglądać] tylko [BOLD:dla twojej jazdy]… Może na to właśnie liczą."
"20690","So, I had another [BOLD:read] of [BOLD:the script]. That they actually sent me this time! [BOLD:Apparently] you are “[BOLD:escaping] from the villain’s [BOLD:underground lair].” And something called a “[BOLD:dimensional invasion]” is about to occur. Wow.","","Znów [BOLD:poczytałem scenariusz]. Tym razem mi go wysłali! [BOLD:Wygląda na to], że ''[BOLD:uciekasz z podziemnej kryjówki] złoczyńcy''. I ma nastąpić jakaś ''[BOLD:międzywymiarowa inwazja]''. Wow."
"20691","So, remember when I said a lot of computer stuff? Ignore that. We’ve got [BOLD:multiple barricades, tunnels, and jumps].

"20693","Looking good. Now, [BOLD:gun it through here]. There’s a [BOLD:ramp by] the [BOLD:bridge]. [BOLD:Jump it]. Plow through the junk on the far side.

"20694","[BOLD:Tunnel’s littered] with big stuff. [BOLD:Follow the route] and get some [BOLD:good swerves] in, though.

[BOLD:Uważaj], bo parę przeszkód jest naprawdę dużych."
"20695","Now, [BOLD:out] the [BOLD:final barricade], and [BOLD:hit the jump]!","","Teraz [BOLD:ostatnia barykada] i [BOLD:zaraz skok]!"
"20696","Ever done [BOLD:advertising work]? It’s [BOLD:good money] but it can get a [BOLD:bit boring]. That’s why you’ve [BOLD:got to have some fun] with it. Wait till you see what I mean.","","Masz jakieś [BOLD:doświadczenie w reklamie]? [BOLD:Dobre pieniądze], ale czasem [BOLD:wyziera nuda]. Dlatego dobrze sobie przy tym [BOLD:niekiedy poszaleć].

"20857","In [BOLD:2010], though, [BOLD:production restarted ]at Sutton-in-Ashfield.

"20910","The [BOLD:Mini Cooper S] was built to be a [BOLD:performance machine].

"21215","I hear [BOLD:congratulations] are in order, [BOLD:Speed Champion]! Thought about where you’re going to put that [BOLD:trophy]?

"21222","Now [BOLD:LEGO needs] a [BOLD:Speed Champion], and the [BOLD:festival needs Master Builders]. And you… you need a place to live.

Tobie natomiast… potrzeba chaty. Oto [BOLD:płytka konstrukcyjna], na której [BOLD:wzniesiesz swój] własny [BOLD:dom majstra budowniczego]."
"21223","First things first. [BOLD:You need bricks]. Lots of bricks. [BOLD:You can get] them by [BOLD:completing Brick Challenges].","","Ale od początku… [BOLD:Potrzeba ci klocków]. Mnóstwa klocków. Aby je zdobyć, [BOLD:ukończ wyzwania klockowe]."
"21224","That has to be the [BOLD:biggest], [BOLD:brightest], and [BOLD:best house] I’ve ever seen. Which at Horizon LEGO Valley is saying something. [BOLD:Nice job].","","To musi być [BOLD:największy], [BOLD:najbarwniejszy] i [BOLD:najwspanialszy] dom, jaki moje oczy widziały. A w Dolinie LEGO w Horizon to coś znaczy! [BOLD:Dobra robota]."
"21225","I remember when this was just an empty baseplate and a dream. [BOLD:Congratulations]! And uh, may I suggest you [BOLD:take a picture] or something? Because [BOLD:now you’re in] with the [BOLD:LEGO Master Builders], this is [BOLD:only the beginning].","","Pamiętam, gdy mieliśmy tu tylko jedną płytkę konstrukcyjną i naszą wizję. [BOLD:Gratulacje]!

"21227","[BOLD:I wish] I could have [BOLD:built this fast] when I was a kid. You sure you’re [BOLD:not already] a [BOLD:Master Builder]?","","[BOLD:Szkoda], że nie potrafiłam [BOLD:budować tak szybko], gdy byłam dzieckiem. Na pewno nie jesteś jeszcze [BOLD:majstrem budowniczym]?"
"21228","You’re cleared to [BOLD:build your next house upgrade]! Just tell me if I need to get special permission or warn the neighbours, okay?","","Masz pozwolenie na [BOLD:kolejną rozbudowę]. Tylko daj znać, czy trzeba załatwić jakieś specjalne zezwolenia lub ostrzec sąsiadów."
"21229","Do we have [BOLD:enough bricks]? Not you, [BOLD:you’re good to start building]. I’m wondering if we have enough left in the rest of the valley.","","Mamy [BOLD:wystarczającą liczbę klocków]? Ty masz, [BOLD:to akurat widzę]. Ale zastanawia mnie, czy zostały jeszcze jakiekolwiek w całej dolinie."
"21230","Well. So much for “highly classified”. Let’s [BOLD:build this thing].","","Cóż, tyle zostało ze ''ścisłej tajności''. [BOLD:Złóżmy to do kupy]."

"21234","Got the [BOLD:Bricks]? Right, [BOLD:take ’em home] and [BOLD:get building]. I mean, they’re only plastic but you don’t want to be lugging them around, do you?","","Masz [BOLD:klocki]? To dobrze. [BOLD:Zabierz je do domu] i zacznij [BOLD:budować]. Wiem, że są plastikowe, ale chyba nie zamierzasz targać ich wszędzie ze sobą, czyż nie?"
"21235","Confirmed. [BOLD:Brick threshold reached]. LEGO control room says [BOLD:you’re go for build]. Yes, we have a LEGO control room. Don’t ask.","","Potwierdzam. [BOLD:Pułap klocków osiągnięty]. Sterownia LEGO zezwala na [BOLD:rozpoczęcie budowy]. Tak, mamy sterownię LEGO. Nie pytaj."
"21236","Right, you [BOLD:get the bricks back to the site], I’ll try to get the final instructions off the LEGO team. They do like to tinker.","","No dobra. [BOLD:Zawieź klocki na plac budowy], a ja postaram się zdobyć instrukcje od ekipy LEGO. Oni lubią majsterkować."
"21237","[BOLD:Got the bricks]? Alright, [BOLD:head to your house] and… oh. You know what you’re doing. You’re [BOLD:soon to be] a [BOLD:Master Builder] after all.","","[BOLD:Masz klocki]? No dobra. [BOLD:Ruszaj do domu] i… Zresztą dobrze wiesz, co masz robić. W końcu [BOLD:wkrótce] uzyskasz [BOLD:tytuł majstra budowniczego]."
"21238","You’ve [BOLD:got a lot of bricks] stashed. What does Horizon LEGO Valley’s newest Master Builder [BOLD:need] on their [BOLD:house]? Well, maybe “need” isn’t the word. More like “think would look cool on”.","","Widzę, że masz [BOLD:niezły stosik klocków]. Jakiego ulepszenia [BOLD:potrzebuje] najnowszy majster budowniczy Doliny LEGO w Horizon? Może nie tyle ''potrzebuje'', ile ''spoko by wyglądało''."
"21239","Heads up, the [BOLD:LEGO Master Builders Guild] wants you to [BOLD:start collecting bricks] for your next [BOLD:House Upgrade]. They won’t even let me into their meetings. What on earth are you planning next?","","Przynoszę wieści. [BOLD:Gildia majstrów budowniczych LEGO] prosi cię o [BOLD:zebranie klocków] potrzebnych do realizacji następnego [BOLD:ulepszenia domu]. Cóż takiego mogą planować? Na swoje tajne obrady nie chcą wpuścić nawet mnie!"
"21240","It’s not like our LEGO crops need dusting or anything, but how would the [BOLD:Master Builder] like to have a go at a [BOLD:LEGO biplane]?","","Wprawdzie uprawy LEGO nie potrzebują oprysków, ale co [BOLD:majster budowniczy] powie na lot [BOLD:LEGO-dwupłatowcem]?"
"21241","Ahh, how many [BOLD:more upgrades] are you and the other [BOLD:Master Builders] planning? It’s fine, I just… someone has to order in all the LEGO bricks, remember.","","Ile jeszcze [BOLD:ulepszeń] planujecie razem z innymi [BOLD:majstrami budowniczymi]? Nie mam nic przeciwko, ale… pamiętaj, że ktoś musi załatwić te wszystkie klocki LEGO."
"21242","How about some [BOLD:more Master Builder instructions]? Fair warning, I found these ones in a folder marked “DANGER - TOP SECRET [BOLD:LEGO DINOSAUR] PROJECT”.","","Co powiesz na [BOLD:kolejną instrukcję dla majstrów budowniczych]? Tylko ostrożnie. Tę znalazłam w katalogu z notatką: ''UWAGA! ŚCIŚLE TAJNY PROJEKT [BOLD:LEGO-DINOZAURA]''."
"21243","You know what? I give up. [BOLD:You] and the other Master Builders [BOLD:build whatever you want] on your houses. Just… if it spins or lights up, you’ll let me know, won’t you?","","No dobra. Poddaję się. [BOLD:Ty] i inni majstrowie budowniczy możecie [BOLD:rozbudowywać] sobie chaty tak, [BOLD:jak się wam żywnie podoba]. Tylko daj znać, jeśli ulepszenie ma zacząć wirować lub zająć się ogniem."
"21244","Alright, so I might have been snooping in the highly classified [BOLD:LEGO instructions] again, and I found this one. “File 51 - [BOLD:unidentified LEGO object]”. What do you reckon that could be?","","No dobra, znów powęszyłam trochę w ściśle tajnych [BOLD:instrukcjach LEGO] i znalazłam tę: ''Akta 51 – [BOLD:niezidentyfikowany obiekt LEGO]''. Jak myślisz, co to może być?"
"21245","Right, well, [BOLD:house is finished] now, that’s good. Are you [BOLD:kidding]? [BOLD:More bricks]! [BOLD:More challenges]! [BOLD:Add] on [BOLD:more things] to [BOLD:your house]! Do you know how to play with LEGO or what?","","No dobra, [BOLD:dom ukończony]. Świetnie, tak? [BOLD:Żarty] sobie stroisz? Trzeba nam [BOLD:więcej klocków]! Ukończ [BOLD:więcej wyzwań] i [BOLD:rozbuduj swój dom]! Nie wiesz, jak się układa klocki LEGO, czy co?"
"21246","So what’s the [BOLD:first thing] you need to [BOLD:add to your LEGO house]? Um hello, Horizon here. [BOLD:A garage] of course! Better [BOLD:get to work] on those [BOLD:challenges].","","Co chcesz dobudować do swojego [BOLD:LEGO-domu w pierwszej kolejności]? No halo! To przecież Horizon. Ma się rozumieć, że [BOLD:garaż]! Lepiej [BOLD:bierz się za te wyzwania]."
"21247","You should know, we’ve had [BOLD:complaints] from the [BOLD:LEGO council] about [BOLD:your house]. There’s [BOLD:not nearly enough] of it yet. Time to [BOLD:start collecting bricks] for [BOLD:another upgrade]?","","[BOLD:Rada LEGO] przekazała mi [BOLD:skargi] dotyczące [BOLD:twojego domu]. Jest [BOLD:za mało spektakularny]. Czy nie czas [BOLD:zacząć gromadzić klocki] na [BOLD:kolejną rozbudowę]?"
"21248","According to the instructions this [BOLD:new LEGO house upgrade] is a “[BOLD:combination living area] and [BOLD:rear sunroom]”.

Czas [BOLD:zgromadzić klocki] na [BOLD:kolejną rozbudowę]."
"21249","I took some of the [BOLD:LEGO people] for a [BOLD:tour of your house]. They love it, they just have some tiny [BOLD:suggested upgrades]. You’re going to [BOLD:need a lot of bricks].","","[BOLD:Oprowadziłam] kilku [BOLD:ludzi z LEGO] po [BOLD:twoim domu]. Są pod wrażeniem, ale mają pewne malutkie [BOLD:sugestie] dotyczące przyszłej rozbudowy. Przyda ci się [BOLD:sporo klocków]."
"21250","Now, I need some of these [BOLD:Brick Challenges] tidied up [BOLD:around the valley] and you need a [BOLD:new wing] on [BOLD:your LEGO house]. Perhaps we can come to an arrangement.","","Przydałoby się załatwić część z tych [BOLD:klockowych wyzwań w dolinie]. Zebrać trochę klocków na [BOLD:nowe skrzydło] do [BOLD:twojego LEGO-domu]. Możemy się zgrać."
"21251","Uhh, there’s [BOLD:LEGO scattered all over] my nice clean [BOLD:valley]. [BOLD:Go collect it] all up and stick it on [BOLD:your next house upgrade], will you?","","Rany! Klocki [BOLD:LEGO walają się] po wszystkich zakątkach mojej pięknej [BOLD:doliny]. [BOLD:Pozbieraj je] i [BOLD:rozbuduj] za ich pomocą [BOLD:swój dom], dobrze?"
"21252","How about, I dunno, an [BOLD:attic bedroom] and [BOLD:roof terrace] on [BOLD:your LEGO house]? In case friends visit. Which they will, when they see your house. Off you go and [BOLD:get some bricks].","","Co powiesz na, dajmy na to, [BOLD:sypialnię na poddaszu] albo [BOLD:taras na dachu swojego LEGO-domu]? Tak na wypadek wizyty znajomych. A na pewno cię odwiedzą, gdy tylko zobaczą twój dom. Ruszaj po [BOLD:więcej klocków]."
"21253","You know, I’m seeing [BOLD:Horizon drivers around the valley] with [BOLD:bigger houses than yours]. Just saying. If you want to do something about that [BOLD:get to those Brick Challenges]!","","Powiem ci, że wielu [BOLD:kierowców Horizon w dolinie] ma [BOLD:większe domy od ciebie]. Tak tylko mówię. Jeśli chcesz coś z tym zrobić, zajmij się tymi [BOLD:klockowymi wyzwaniami]."
"21254","Your [BOLD:next upgrade instructions] are for a [BOLD:LEGO]… uh, [BOLD:football pitch]? I don’t… is the ball made of LEGO? Surely that wouldn’t… We’ll figure it out later. Off you go and [BOLD:collect the bricks].","","[BOLD:Kolejny dodatek] z klocków [BOLD:LEGO] to… Co takiego? [BOLD:Boisko do piłki nożnej]? Sama nie wiem… Piłka też jest z klocków LEGO? Przecież to… Później to ustalimy. Teraz ruszaj po [BOLD:więcej klocków]."
"21255","The LEGO architects tell me [BOLD:your house could] easily [BOLD:support another upgrade]. In fact they said structurally it could support half a dozen, [BOLD:you up for it]?","","Architekci LEGO powiedzieli mi, że konstrukcja nośna [BOLD:twojego domu] spokojnie wytrzyma [BOLD:kolejną rozbudowę]. A nawet kilka nowych ulepszeń. [BOLD:Co ty na to]?"
"21256","Ready to [BOLD:put in] your [BOLD:LEGO pool and cabana]? Great! Better [BOLD:grab some bricks]. Remember, you don’t have to pull your legs off to make it look like you’re swimming. You’re not a Minifigure.","","Co powiesz na budowę własnego [BOLD:LEGO-basenu i kabinki plażowej]? Świetnie! W takim razie [BOLD:załatw trochę klocków]. Pamiętaj, że nie musisz wyrywać sobie nóg, żeby popływać. Nie jesteś minifigurką."
"21257","Just so you know, you’re a [BOLD:handful of bricks] and [BOLD:one house upgrade away] from [BOLD:joining] the exclusive ranks of the [BOLD:Horizon LEGO Valley Master Builders Guild].

To dopiero coś, nie? Ruszaj więc [BOLD:ukończyć kolejne klockowe wyzwania]!"
"21258","Apparently the [BOLD:final requirement] for [BOLD:joining the Master Builders Guild] is that you [BOLD:build] a picturesque [BOLD:LEGO log cabin]… and a [BOLD:pond] to go with it. [BOLD:More LEGO bricks] it is!","","Wygląda na to, że [BOLD:ostatnim wymogiem], który trzeba spełnić, żeby [BOLD:przyjęli cię do gildii majstrów budowniczych] jest budowa malowniczej [BOLD:LEGO-chaty z bali]… i [BOLD:stawu] obok niej. Wiesz, co to oznacza. Trzeba nam [BOLD:więcej klocków LEGO]!"
"21259","So, the [BOLD:LEGO people] have been [BOLD:holding onto some] of their more, shall we say, [BOLD:experimental house designs] waiting for a [BOLD:Master Builder] capable of building them.

"21260","Luckily our [BOLD:Horizon and LEGO techs] have been back at work and have [BOLD:given you access] to [BOLD:new Brick Challenges] all over the valley.

"21263","Oh, and we’ve [BOLD:unlocked] a bunch [BOLD:more Brick Challenges]. You know, if you already have expansion plans in mind.","","Aha, [BOLD:odblokowaliśmy] też sporo nowych [BOLD:klockowych wyzwań]. Wiesz, gdyby przyszły ci do głowy kolejne pomysły na ulepszenia."
"21264","I know it’s only a [BOLD:baseplate] but you’ll probably want to [BOLD:set this as your home] so long as you’re competing here in [BOLD:LEGO Valley]. Just use your imagination for now.","","Wiem, że to tylko [BOLD:płytka konstrukcyjna], ale w trakcie rywalizacji w [BOLD:Dolinie LEGO] będzie [BOLD:twoim domem]. Na razie użyj swojej wyobraźni."
"21265","Another [BOLD:Brick Challenge] down, nice. But you’re still [BOLD:a few bricks short] of your [BOLD:house].

Uwierz mi, nie chcesz mieć dziurawego dachu."
"21266","You’re only a [BOLD:few bricks away] from putting a [BOLD:LEGO roof] over your head. So [BOLD:which challenge] will it be [BOLD:next]?","","Jeszcze tylko [BOLD:kilka klocków] i będziesz mieć swój własny [BOLD:LEGO-dach] nad głową. [BOLD:Które wyzwanie] będzie [BOLD:następne]?"

Make it a bit of a game, you see.","","Na spotkaniu [BOLD:Drift Clubu] [BOLD:zadecydowaliśmy, że będziemy zapisywać wyniki] członków klubu [BOLD:na] wszystkich [BOLD:trasach]. Takie trochę zawody."
"21375","Ah, it’s all computers now. There are [BOLD:people sharing “drift tunes”] that you [BOLD:download and install] on your car to set gearing ratios!","","Teraz wszystko robią komputery. [BOLD:Ludzie udostępniają ''ustawienia driftu''], które można [BOLD:ściągnąć i zainstalować] w aucie, żeby ustawić przełożenie!"
"21376","The [BOLD:Horizon Festival] has a [BOLD:database] of these [BOLD:Tunes]! I prefer to do it all myself. I suppose I’m a bit of a purist.","","Na [BOLD:festiwalu Horizon] mają całą [BOLD:bazę] tych [BOLD:ustawień]! Ja wolę robić wszystko samemu. Chyba trochę ze mnie purysta."
"21377","I’d like us to be known as an inclusive club. You [BOLD:don’t need] a [BOLD:Japanese performance machine] to throw around… An [BOLD:American performance machine’ll do] very nicely too.","","Chcę, żeby klub był otwarty na ludzi. [BOLD:Nie trzeba] mieć [BOLD:mocnej japońskiej maszyny], żeby się trochę porozbijać… [BOLD:Mocna amerykańska wystarczy]."
"21378","This [BOLD:Route] is [BOLD:quite lengthy] so [BOLD:you’ll need] a good bit of [BOLD:forward as well as sideways].","","Ta [BOLD:trasa] jest [BOLD:dosyć długa], [BOLD:musisz] nieźle pruć [BOLD:do przodu, nie tylko na boki]."
"21379","You make it look really easy. [BOLD:Liven up] the [BOLD:rear], [BOLD:apply] a bit of [BOLD:acceleration], then [BOLD:steer]. And Robert is your father’s brother!","","W twoim wykonaniu wygląda to łatwo. [BOLD:Rusz tyłem], [BOLD:przyspiesz trochę], potem [BOLD:kieruj]. Cyk, pyk i zrobione!"
"21380","Good news, [BOLD:Drift Club membership is climbing] steadily [BOLD:thanks to you]! As soon as I get the membership cards and name badges ready you’ll be the first to know.","","Dobre wieści, [BOLD:Drift Club ma dzięki tobie coraz więcej członków]! Dam ci znać, jak tylko będę miał karty członkowskie i plakietki z imionami."
"21381","Force equals mass times acceleration, minus friction. [BOLD:Drifting is all mathematics], you see. I do like mathematics.","","Siła równa się masa razy przyspieszenie minus tarcie. Widzisz, [BOLD:cały drifting to matematyka]. Lubię matmę, to królowa nauk."
"21382","Though, you might say it’s as easy as [BOLD:braking] on the way [BOLD:into the turn], to make the back lively. This [BOLD:shifts weight] onto [BOLD:to the front] of the car, [BOLD:increasing grip], and [BOLD:reducing weight] on the [BOLD:rear wheels].","","Ale ktoś mógłby powiedzieć, że to po prostu [BOLD:hamowanie] przy [BOLD:wejściu w zakręt], żeby rozruszać tył. [BOLD:Ciężar przenosi] się na [BOLD:przód samochodu], [BOLD:zwiększając przyczepność] i [BOLD:zmniejszając obciążenie] [BOLD:tylnych kół]."
"21383","I’ve thrown on new [BOLD:high-grip front tires], [BOLD:tuned] the [BOLD:throttle response] in the computer, and [BOLD:lowered] it [BOLD:on firm springs]… Well, if you get to show off then so do I.","","Założyłem nowe [BOLD:przednie opony o wysokiej przyczepności], [BOLD:wyregulowałem] [BOLD:reakcję przepustnicy] w komputerze i [BOLD:zainstalowałem twarde resory]… Skoro ty się możesz popisywać, to ja też."
"21384","I’ve put in a [BOLD:Route] down [BOLD:to] the [BOLD:old rail yard]. I think you’ll see what I’m getting at.","","Ustawiłem [BOLD:trasę] [BOLD:do] [BOLD:starej bocznicy kolejowej]. Myślę, że zrozumiesz, o co mi chodzi."
"21385","I’m [BOLD:really chuffed] Joel persuaded [BOLD:you] to [BOLD:front up our little band]. I think it’s just [BOLD:the thing we needed]. If we really want to be taken seriously, we need a bit of a personality to lead the way. A nice one. Anyway, no more said about that.","","[BOLD:Bardzo się cieszę], że Joel namówił [BOLD:cię] do roli [BOLD:frontmana naszego zespołu]. Tego nam [BOLD:było trzeba]. Jeśli chcemy być brani na serio, potrzeba nam osobowości na przedzie. Miłej osobowości. Dobra, koniec tematu."
"21386","There’s a [BOLD:nice spot] on the way [BOLD:up to Edinburgh] that Drift Club’s been eyeing up. I think you’ve earned the right to [BOLD:have first crack] and [BOLD:show off a little]. What do you reckon?","","Jest takie [BOLD:fajne miejsce] na drodze [BOLD:do Edynburga], na które Drift Club ma oko. Myślę, że zasługujesz, żeby [BOLD:być pierwszą osobą], która się [BOLD:tam popisze]. Co ty na to?"
"21387","Now, when I said “no rush,” what I should have said was “[BOLD:hurry up] and [BOLD:get to the finish] line.” Sorry.","","Powiedziałem ''bez pośpiechu'', prawda? Wybacz, miałem na myśli ''[BOLD:pospiesz się i dojedź do mety]''."
"21388","And up here, just [BOLD:take] a cheeky little [BOLD:detour down the side]!","","I tu w górę, [BOLD:zrób] tylko [BOLD:objaździk wzdłuż zbocza]!"
"21389","Well… [BOLD:off you go], then. No rush. Do Drift Club proud.","","No… [BOLD:to ruszaj]. Bez pośpiechu. Daj Drift Clubowi powody do dumy."
"21390","[BOLD:98 Silvia K], [BOLD:2.6-liter inline six], and the [BOLD:full Rocket Bunny “Boss” kit]… I might have got a little carried away here, but I was sure you wouldn’t mind.","","[BOLD:Silvia K z 98'], [BOLD:sześciocylindrowy silnik rzędowy o pojemności 2,6 litra] i [BOLD:pełny pakiet Rocket Bunny Boss]… Trochę mnie poniosło, ale to ci chyba nie przeszkadza."
"21391","Remember when I talked about “too much power”? [BOLD:This is too much power]. You really [BOLD:shouldn’t need] to [BOLD:floor it]. [BOLD:Watch the rear]. It’s slippy. If [BOLD:it comes out], you’re [BOLD:using too much power]!","","Pamiętasz, jak mówiłem o ''za dużej ilości mocy''? [BOLD:To jest za duża ilość mocy]. [BOLD:Nie musisz] wciskać gazu [BOLD:do dechy]. [BOLD:Obserwuj tył]. Jest ślisko. Jeśli [BOLD:go ściąga], [BOLD:używasz za dużo mocy]!"
"21392","What did you make of that? If we get ’em used to long drives, we can have Drift Clubbers laying down rubber in every corner of the UK.","","Co o tym myślisz? Jeśli przyzwyczaimy ich do długiej jazdy, członkowie klubu będą mogli palić gumę w każdym zakątku Wielkiej Brytanii."
"21393","Onwards and upwards, eh? We’ll take [BOLD:a longer drift drive this time], show Drift Clubbers the skills and technical challenges involved in covering that sort of distance.","","Byle do przodu, co? Tym razem [BOLD:dłużej pojedziemy driftem] i zademonstrujemy członkom Drift Clubu, jakie trzeba mieć umiejętności i jakie są techniczne trudności przy takich odległościach."
"21394","[BOLD:Friction] is what [BOLD:everyone wants to see]. [BOLD:Not actual friction], of course, [BOLD:because] that’s an [BOLD:invisible force]. There’s no way to see an invisible force.","","[BOLD:Wszyscy chcą zobaczyć tarcie]. Oczywiście nie chodzi o [BOLD:faktyczne tarcie], [BOLD:bo] to tylko [BOLD:niewidzialna siła]. Niewidzialnej siły nie można zobaczyć."
"21395","What you [BOLD:can see], however, is [BOLD:clouds of smoke] from [BOLD:tires] starting to [BOLD:burn at 121.11] degrees [BOLD:Celsius]… or [BOLD:250 degrees Farenheit] for those who prefer Imperial measurements, of course.","","Za to [BOLD:można zobaczyć] [BOLD:chmury dymu] z [BOLD:opon], które zaczynają się [BOLD:palić przy 121,11] stopniach [BOLD:Celsjusza] — albo [BOLD:250 stopniach Farenheita] dla tych, którzy preferują imperialne jednostki miary."
"21396","And [BOLD:just the car]. [BOLD:Borrowed] this [BOLD:from Jaimin] at the Festival. Nice young fella, if a [BOLD:little excitable]. Practically flung the keys at me when I said I’d be handin’ it over to you.","","I [BOLD:odpowiedni samochód]. [BOLD:Pożyczyłem] go [BOLD:od Jaimina] na festiwalu. Miły chłopak, chociaż [BOLD:łatwo się ekscytuje]. Prawie rzucił we mnie kluczami, gdy dowiedział się, że to dla ciebie."
"21397","Here we go. A nice [BOLD:technical drive] on [BOLD:mixed road surfaces]… I do love the technical ones.","","Proszę bardzo. [BOLD:Techniczny przejazd] po [BOLD:różnych nawierzchniach]… Uwielbiam te techniczne."
"21398","Now, [BOLD:some people claim] that you [BOLD:have to use rear-wheel] drive cars [BOLD:to drift]. That is simply [BOLD:not true]! Some of the greatest proponents of functional over-steering… or drifting, if you prefer… come from Stage Rally! And some of them predate Mr. Takahashi.","","[BOLD:Niektórzy twierdzą], że do [BOLD:driftowania] potrzebne są [BOLD:samochody z napędem na tylne koła]. [BOLD:To nieprawda]! Pośród największych zwolenników funkcjonalnej nadsterowności — albo driftingu, jeśli wolisz — są rajdowcy! Niektórzy z nich driftowali nawet przed Takahashim."
"21399","Ever [BOLD:tried drifting uphill]? It’s [BOLD:quite a skill], I’ll admit I’m useless at it. But you’re going to show Drift Club it can be done and [BOLD:I’ve found just the spot] for it.","","Umiesz [BOLD:driftować pod górę]? To [BOLD:nie byle jaka umiejętność]… przyznam, że sam jestem w tym beznadziejny. Ale ty pokażesz Drift Clubowi, że da się to zrobić. [BOLD:Znam odpowiednie miejsce]."
"21400","Balance is key! [BOLD:Steer and counter-steer], enough [BOLD:throttle to push] the [BOLD:powerslide], enough [BOLD:brake to hold] your [BOLD:grip]… You know, I really should be writing these bits of wisdom down somewhere.","","Balans to klucz! [BOLD:Skręty, przeciwskręty], [BOLD:gaz], żeby można było [BOLD:wejść w poślizg], [BOLD:hamulce dla przyczepności]… W sumie powinienem zapisywać gdzieś te mądrości."
"21401","On the [BOLD:uphill] you’re [BOLD:fighting traction loss], [BOLD:burning power], and still [BOLD:relying on momentum] to carry you through. Though I’m sure you’re takin’ all this into account already!","","Jadąc [BOLD:pod górę], [BOLD:walczysz z utratą trakcji], [BOLD:spalasz moc] i ciągle [BOLD:potrzebujesz rozpędu]. Ale jestem pewny, że już to bierzesz pod uwagę!"
"21402","[BOLD:This] rather nice vehicle, [BOLD:for instance], featuring a few little [BOLD:adjustments of my own]. I think you’ll find it more than adequate.","","[BOLD:Na przykład] [BOLD:ten] sympatyczny pojazd, troszkę przy nim [BOLD:majstrowałem]. Powinien cię więcej niż zadowolić."
"21403","[BOLD:Sweden], for instance. This is the [BOLD:Volvo 242 Turbo Evolution], featuring a few little [BOLD:adjustments of my own]. I think you’ll find it more than adequate.","","Na przykład ze [BOLD:Szwecji]. To jest [BOLD:Volvo 242 Turbo Evolution], trochę przy nim [BOLD:pomajstrowałem] — powinno cię więcej niż zadowolić."
"21404","[BOLD:Course is laid out], though you’re welcome to [BOLD:have] a little [BOLD:fun on the way].","","[BOLD:Trasa ustawiona]. Ale jeśli chcesz, [BOLD:możesz] się trochę [BOLD:zabawić po drodze]."
"21405","There, you see, this is just my point! [BOLD:People think drifting] is simply [BOLD:losing control] of the vehicle. When [BOLD:in fact] you are delicately balancing traction loss with grip… It’s a [BOLD:carefully controlled loss of control], is what I’m saying.","","Widzisz, o to mi właśnie chodziło! [BOLD:Ludzie myślą, że driftowanie] to po prostu [BOLD:utrata kontroli] nad wozem. [BOLD:Tak naprawdę] to subtelne manipulowanie utratą przyczepności… Chodzi mi o [BOLD:uważnie kontrolowaną utratę kontroli]."
"21406","[BOLD:Some] also [BOLD:claim] that [BOLD:Japanese or American cars] are the [BOLD:only options] for functional oversteer. This is [BOLD:also not true]. Here at Drift Club we find drift machines in all sorts of odd places.","","[BOLD:Niektórzy] [BOLD:uważają] też, że [BOLD:tylko] [BOLD:japońskie albo amerykańskie samochody] nadają się do funkcjonalnej nadsterowności. [BOLD:To też nieprawda]. Drift Club znajduje maszyny do driftu w najróżniejszych miejscach."
"21407","Ahem… in any case. Meet the [BOLD:classic 1969 Mustang Boss]. An incredible machine. And that was before they let yours truly under the hood.","","Ekhm… w każdym razie. Oto [BOLD:klasyczny Mustang Boss z 1969 roku]. Niesamowita maszyna. I myślałem tak, nawet zanim dostałem się pod maskę."
"21408","These long country drives are perfect for spreading Drift Club far and wide. So if you could [BOLD:make your way to Broadway] for me, please.","","Te długie podróże poza miastem to świetne okazje do promowania Drift Clubu. [BOLD:Jedź, proszę, na Broadway]."
"21409","Well now, the [BOLD:spirit of Mr. Takahashi] is [BOLD:alive and well] in Horizon Drift Club! … While the spirit of Robert Glenn is more than happy endlessly fiddling with his engine and suspension, thank you very much.","","No, teraz [BOLD:duch pana Takahashiego] [BOLD:ożył] w Drift Clubie Horizon! Tymczasem duch Roberta Glenna jest w pełni szczęśliwy, majstrując przy silniku i zawieszeniu."
"21410","Joel tells me there are [BOLD:Drift Clubs] popping up [BOLD:all over] the continent! [BOLD:Berlin, Paris, Amsterdam]. I didn’t start those ones. Did you start those ones? … Should I send them the newsletter?","","Joel powiedział mi, że [BOLD:Drift Cluby] pojawiają się [BOLD:na całym kontynencie]! [BOLD:Berlin, Paryż, Amsterdam]. Ja ich nie założyłem. To twoja sprawka? Powinienem im wysłać newsletter?"
"21411","You know, it all began with [BOLD:Kunimitsu Takahashi]. He [BOLD:invented drifting] because he was [BOLD:winning all of his races], and he [BOLD:wanted] a bit of [BOLD:a challenge].","","Wiesz, wszystko zaczęło się od [BOLD:Kunimitsu Takahashiego]. [BOLD:Wynalazł drifting], bo [BOLD:wygrywał wszystkie wyścigi] i [BOLD:pragnął] jakiegoś [BOLD:wyzwania]."
"21412","There you have it. [BOLD:Drifting] is about [BOLD:entertainment], [BOLD:not just engineering]. Some members of our club are a little too fixated on the technical details of drifting, if you ask me.","","Proszę bardzo. [BOLD:Drifting] to [BOLD:rozrywka], [BOLD:nie tylko mechanika]. Moim skromnym zdaniem niektórzy członkowie naszego klubu trochę za bardzo skupiają się na technicznych szczegółach driftingu."
"21413","Easy now. [BOLD:Coming up on] my favorite sequence. The [BOLD:technical bit], with [BOLD:lots of tight turns].","","Ostrożnie — [BOLD:zbliżasz się] do mojego ulubionego odcinka. To [BOLD:techniczny kawałek] z [BOLD:ciasnymi zakrętami]."
"21414","And I’d like to send you in this. [BOLD:Third gen RX-7], [BOLD:sequential twin turbochargers] on a [BOLD:front-engine rear-wheel configuration]. It’s rather good. If you like that sort of thing.","","Chciałbym cię wysłać w tym. [BOLD:RX-7 trzeciej generacji], [BOLD:dwie sekwencyjne turbosprężarki] w [BOLD:konfiguracji silnik z przodu-tylny napęd]. Jest dosyć dobra. Jeśli lubisz takie rzeczy."
"21415","You should know the way… Though of course you’re welcome to [BOLD:use the satnav]. Sorry, I’m not sure why I said that.","","Drogę pewnie znasz… Chociaż oczywiście możesz [BOLD:użyć nawigacji]. Wybacz, sam nie wiem, czemu to powiedziałem."
"21416","[BOLD:There you go]. Edinburgh Drift, if I might be allowed a little joke at the expense of the film industry!","","[BOLD:O, proszę]. Edynburg Drift, jeśli mogę sobie pozwolić na mały żart filmowy!"
"21417","You seemed to enjoy your [BOLD:trip through Edinburgh], so we should try that [BOLD:again].

"21418","Oh, the time! The time! We’re [BOLD:running out of time]! [BOLD:Head for the finish] line!","","O kurczaki, czas! [BOLD:Kończy nam się czas]! [BOLD:Śmigaj na metę]!"
"21419","[BOLD:Traffic is generally light] in the mornings. But I’ve [BOLD:had a friend] on the council [BOLD:close down the roads] for us, so it really won’t be an issue.

Ale poprosiłem [BOLD:znajomego] radnego, żeby [BOLD:zamknął dla nas drogi], więc nie będzie żadnych problemów. Wybacz, znów nie wiem, czemu to powiedziałem."
"21420","[BOLD:Off you go], then. Show Edinburgh what Drift Club is all about!","","[BOLD:Zatem w drogę] — pokaż Edynburgowi, co znaczy Drift Club!"
"21421","The [BOLD:Horizon Festival] is [BOLD:in Britain] this year. You might have heard of it. Big party, proper cars, lots of action. So I [BOLD:thought I’d come] down and [BOLD:see what] all the [BOLD:fuss is about].","","W tym roku [BOLD:festiwal Horizon] odbywa się w [BOLD:Wielkiej Brytanii]. Być może o nim słyszeliście.

"21424","Yes, yes, I know this is all very good fun. But we really [BOLD:need to nail this] bit.","","Wiem, że to ubaw po pachy, ale ten fragment musimy [BOLD:przejechać naprawdę idealnie]."
"21425","Bring it back around, let’s [BOLD:have another crack] at this.","","Zawróć. [BOLD:Spróbujmy] jeszcze raz."
"21426","One more run, I reckon. [BOLD:We’ll get it next time].","","To co? Jeszcze jeden przejazd? [BOLD:Teraz się uda]."
"21427","Oops. Happens to the best of us. [BOLD:One more go] should do it.","","Ups. Zdarza się najlepszym. [BOLD:Następny przejazd] powinien się udać."

"21430","Hang on a minute. [BOLD:What] on earth is [BOLD:The Stig up to]?","","Chwileczkę. [BOLD:Cóż] takiego [BOLD:wyrabia Stig]?"
"21431","Well, [BOLD:they did say] to use the [BOLD:fastest route possible]. And if there’s [BOLD:one thing faster] than a racing line, [BOLD:it’s a straight line]. You’ve got to hand it to the Stig.","","Racja. [BOLD:Powiedzieli], żeby wybrać [BOLD:możliwie najszybszą trasę]. A [BOLD:jedyną trasą szybszą] od linii toru jest [BOLD:linia prosta]. Świetny pomysł, Stig."
"21432","Look, [BOLD:this is] a [BOLD:TRACK car]. It’s even [BOLD:lower than] a [BOLD:normal Elise]. And that suspension is seriously stiff. [BOLD:It is small], I suppose. Great for [BOLD:threading through] traffic. Or, um, [BOLD:trees].","","[BOLD:To] pojazd [BOLD:typowo TOROWY].

"21433","What the? [BOLD:That’s basically a river]. And the [BOLD:Elise] definitely [BOLD:doesn’t have a snorkel]. Or a lifejacket.","","Psiakość. [BOLD:To przecież rzeka]. A [BOLD:Elise] na pewno [BOLD:nie ma maski z rurką]. Ani kamizelki ratunkowej."
"21434","[BOLD:Made it]! Was there ever any doubt? The [BOLD:Series 1 Elise] is, after all, [BOLD:one of] the [BOLD:best-handling cars] ever made. The [BOLD:Sport 190] is its [BOLD:hardcore cousin] – a road-going racer you can drive to work… and across fields, it turns out.

Wszak model [BOLD:Series 1 Elise] to [BOLD:jeden] z [BOLD:najlepiej prowadzących się samochodów] w historii. [BOLD:Sport 190] to jego [BOLD:hardkorowa wersja] — wyścigówka, którą można jeździć do pracy… i po polach, jak się okazuje.

"21435","Ah yes, [BOLD:The Stig]. Our very own UFO. Unidentified Fast Object. The [BOLD:world’s least obedient racing] driver.","","Ach, tak. [BOLD:Oto i Stig]. Nasz własny niezidentyfikowany obiekt pędzący. [BOLD:Najbardziej niesforny kierowca wyścigowy świata]."
"21436","Right then, the [BOLD:Lotus Elise]. A [BOLD:Nineties classic], based on the age-old roadster recipe: [BOLD:two seats, engine in the middle, rear-wheel-drive]. Not an ounce of fat. This is what driving is all about!","","[BOLD:Lotus Elise]. [BOLD:Klasyk z lat 90]. Zaprojektowany zgodnie z prastarym przepisem na roadstera: [BOLD:dwa fotele, silnik na środku i napęd na tylne koła]. Ani grama tłuszczu. Esencja jazdy samochodem!"
"21437","But this isn’t just any Elise. It’s [BOLD:a Sport 190], a [BOLD:tuned-up, stripped-out] Elise… for track days. Even the [BOLD:passenger seat] is an [BOLD:optional extra]. But who needs friends anyway? Friends are expensive. And heavy.","","Ale nie jest to byle jaki Elise, a [BOLD:podrasowana] torowa wersja [BOLD:Sport 190] ze [BOLD:zmniejszonym balastem]. Nawet [BOLD:fotel pasażera] jest w nim [BOLD:opcjonalnym dodatkiem]. W końcu po co komu znajomi? Oni kosztują. I ważą."
"21438","It [BOLD:weighs] well [BOLD:under 700 kilos], and makes [BOLD:190 horsepower] from its [BOLD:1.8-liter engine], which revs to [BOLD:8,000rpm].

"21439","And of course, because it’s a [BOLD:Lotus], it sticks to the [BOLD:famous philosophy] of the man who founded the company – [BOLD:Colin Chapman]. “[BOLD:Simplify, then add lightness]”, he said.

"21440","[BOLD:You’ve got it]. [BOLD:The trick] with drifting is to [BOLD:not actually spin], but to [BOLD:ALMOST spin], for as long as possible.","","[BOLD:Właśnie tak]. [BOLD:Udany] drift [BOLD:nie polega na obracaniu] auta, ale na takiej jeździe, by jak najdłużej [BOLD:PRAWIE się obracać]."

"21447","Seriously. [BOLD:Not funny]. Who gave Stig the keys?","","Serio? [BOLD:To wcale nie jest śmieszne]. Kto dał Stigowi kluczyki?"
"21448","I mean, I literally [BOLD:just cleaned it]. [BOLD:Now] it’s going to [BOLD:smell of onions]. Eau de Stig.","","Dopiero co go [BOLD:umyłem]. [BOLD:Teraz] będzie [BOLD:zajeżdżał cebulową] wodą kolońską Stiga."

"21451","[BOLD:Almost there now]. What a shame! I was really getting into that. [BOLD:Just park it up] now, Stig. Mind the curbs.","","[BOLD:Prawie dojechał]. Szkoda! Zaczynało mi się podobać. [BOLD:Jeszcze tylko zaparkuj], Stig. I uważaj na krawężniki."
"21452","It’s a [BOLD:BMW], so of course it’s [BOLD:rear wheel drive]. [BOLD:50-50 weight distribution] too. It’s a natural-born drifter.","","To [BOLD:BMW], a więc [BOLD:napęd na tylne koła], ma się rozumieć. [BOLD:Rozłożenie masy 50-50]. Stworzony do driftu."
"21453","[BOLD:3-liter straight-six, 335 horsepower, two turbos]… and as much sideways action as you like.","","[BOLD:3-litrowy silnik, 6 cylindrów w rzędzie, 335 koni mechanicznych, podwójne turbo]… Jeździsz bokiem, ile chcesz."
"21454","[BOLD:Look at the smoke]! Just leave me some tread for the drive home, Stiggy. Seriously. Hello?","","[BOLD:Spójrzcie tylko na ten dym]! Zostaw mi choć ociupinę bieżnika na dojechanie do domu, Stiggy. No halo!"
"21455","[BOLD:This isn’t stressful] to watch. Not at all.","","[BOLD:To mnie wcale nie stresuje]. Ani trochę."
"21456","Does [BOLD:0-60 in 4.8 seconds], my 1M. Stig’s way beyond that now…","","[BOLD:Od zera do setki w 4,8 sekundy]. Oto mój 1M. Stig jedzie już dużo szybciej…"
"21457","It’s [BOLD:electronically restrained to 155mph]. So it [BOLD:could] definitely [BOLD:go quicker].","","Ma [BOLD:elektroniczny ogranicznik prędkości do 250 km/h]. Ale na pewno [BOLD:mógłby pojechać szybciej]."
"21458","Ooh, [BOLD:a BMW 1M]. Great car. [BOLD:Hang on], that’s… [BOLD:my BMW 1M].","","Oho, to [BOLD:BMW 1M]. Świetny wóz. [BOLD:Chwileczkę], to… [BOLD:moje BMW 1M]."
"21459","Perfect. It’s a [BOLD:rear-wheel-drive BMW] with a proper [BOLD:limited slip diff]. If it’s not going sideways, something’s wrong.","","Idealny. [BOLD:BMW z napędem na tylne koła] i porządnym [BOLD:mechanizmem różnicowym o ograniczonym poślizgu]. Jeśli nie jedzie bokiem, to coś jest nie tak."
"21460","Have you ever seen anything like it? That’s a [BOLD:new tractor speed record], and some [BOLD:impressively fast farming]. If you want to spread slurry in a hurry, you know what you need. [BOLD:Now though], it’s time to hail a ride in [BOLD:something completely different]…","","Widzieliście kiedyś coś podobnego? [BOLD:Nowy rekord prędkości w klasie traktorów], a do tego [BOLD:imponująco ekspresowa praca na roli]. Jak znalazł, jeśli ma się tylko chwilkę na rozrzucenie gnojówki. [BOLD:Teraz] czas na przejażdżkę [BOLD:czymś z zupełnie innej beczki]…"
"21461","There’s a [BOLD:speed camera on the M68]. Rumour has it, it only [BOLD:flashes above 87.2mph]. Funny that. See, the [BOLD:Track-Tor] has been officially [BOLD:clocked at 87.2mph], making it the world’s fastest tractor. But I reckon it will [BOLD:go even faster]…","","Na autostradzie [BOLD:M68 jest fotoradar]. Podobno strzela fotki tylko [BOLD:po przekroczeniu 140 km/h]. Zabawny zbieg okoliczności, bo nominalna maksymalna prędkość ciągnika [BOLD:Track-Tor] to [BOLD:właśnie 140 km/h], co czyni go najszybszym pojazdem tego typu na świecie. Ale podejrzewam, że [BOLD:da radę pojechać jeszcze szybciej]…"
"21462","Ahh, listen to that. The soothing sounds of the countryside. [BOLD:Birds singing], [BOLD:cows mooing]. A [BOLD:Chevy small-block firing through] a pair of [BOLD:smokestacks].","","Posłuchajcie tylko. Kojące odgłosy sielankowej wsi. [BOLD:Ptaszki śpiewają], [BOLD:krówki muczą], a [BOLD:silnik Chevy pluje ogniem przez kominy wydechowe]."
"21463","Steady on Stig. Those are [BOLD:54-inch mud tires], remember. They get a bit [BOLD:squishy through the corners]. Nobody needs to get the harvest in THAT quickly.","","Ostrożnie, Stig. Pamiętaj, że to [BOLD:54-calowe opony terenowe]. Nieco [BOLD:miękną na wirażach]. Przecież nikt nie musi dowieźć plonów aż tak szybko!"
"21464","Right. Back to the actual script now… if you don’t mind. This is [BOLD:Top Gear’s Track-Tor]. It’s [BOLD:a tractor], obviously, but with a [BOLD:5.7-liter Chevy V8], making [BOLD:500 horsepower]. And here comes the Stig again. [BOLD:Farm Stig]. Born in a barn, they say. [BOLD:Weaned by pigs]. Can plough a field in under six seconds.","","Wróćmy do oryginalnego scenariusza, jeśli łaska. Oto [BOLD:Track-Tor Top Gear]. [BOLD:Ciągnik], jak widać, ale z silnikiem z [BOLD:Chevy: V8, 5,7 litra, 500 koni mechanicznych]. I ponownie Stig. [BOLD:W wiejskiej stylówie]. Mówią, że urodził się w stodole, a [BOLD:przewijały go prosiaki]. Potrafi przeorać pole w niecałe sześć sekund."
"21465","Wait, that’s the wrong? Oh I see what’s happening here. [BOLD:Going for] a bit of [BOLD:a run up], eh?","","Chwileczkę, nie w tę stronę… Aha, już rozumiem. [BOLD:Musisz się trochę rozpędzić], co?"
"21466","Hmm… that’s [BOLD:probably far enough], if you want to [BOLD:make it to] that [BOLD:speed camera in time]. I mean, this is [BOLD:still a tractor] after all. Even with 500 horsepower under the Stig’s racing welly.","","[BOLD:Powinno wystarczyć]. Żeby tylko [BOLD:dojechał] do tego [BOLD:fotoradaru przed zachodem słońca]. To przecież [BOLD:nadal ciągnik], choć Stig ma 500 koni mechanicznych pod gumofilcem."
"21467","Right, [BOLD:here comes the speed camera]. Hope they’ve put some film in it.","","[BOLD:Zbliża się do fotoradaru]. Mam nadzieję, że założyli kliszę."
"21468","Looking good. [BOLD:Keep it pinned]. That should set it off!","","Wygląda to nieźle. [BOLD:Gaz do dechy]. Powinno wypalić!"
"21469","Seriously, [BOLD:how fast] is that thing [BOLD:going]? That’s a tractor that [BOLD:won’t hold up traffic].","","[BOLD:Jak szybko] może [BOLD:jechać] ciągnik? Taki to na pewno [BOLD:nie będzie hamował ruchu]."
"21470","[BOLD:Good work] from the Stig there. I’d say we’re nicely [BOLD:warmed up for the next bit].","","Stig wykonał kawał [BOLD:dobrej roboty]. [BOLD:Rozgrzaliśmy wóz przed kolejnym fragmentem]."
"21471","So I [BOLD:had a word with Isha]. Asked if we could [BOLD:borrow her cab] for a trip to the seaside. [BOLD:To Bamburgh Beach], in fact, where we could [BOLD:stretch the taxi’s legs] a bit. Although I might have forgotten to tell her who’d be driving… You’ve guessed it. The cabbie who’ll always get you to your destination very early. But probably won’t be anywhere near where you asked to go.","","[BOLD:Pożyczyłem od Ishy] jedną taksówkę na wypad nad morze, a dokładnie na [BOLD:plażę Bamburgh]. To świetne miejsce na to, by trochę [BOLD:rozruszać tę taryfę]. Być może zapomniałem napomknąć Ishy, kto będzie siedział za kółkiem… Dobrze zgadliście. Taksiarz, który zawsze dowiezie was przed czasem. Ale raczej nie tam, gdzie chcieliście."
"21472","Now that’s what I call a cab! No clattery diesel engine here, this has a [BOLD:V12 with over 750 horsepower]. Plus bucket seats. Beaded bucket seats, presumably.","","To dopiero taksówka! Żaden tam klekoczący diesel, a [BOLD:V12 o mocy ponad 750 koni mechanicznych]. Do tego kubełkowe fotele. Pewnie z koralikową matą."
"21473","From now on, I say [BOLD:all cabs should have wide bodies] and [BOLD:flared arches]. Think about it: [BOLD:more stability], more [BOLD:speed], more [BOLD:downforce]. More room for your terrified passengers.","","[BOLD:Wszystkie taksówki powinny mieć szersze nadwozia] i [BOLD:nadkola]. Pomyślcie tylko! [BOLD:Więcej stabilności], [BOLD:prędkości] i [BOLD:siły docisku]. Więcej przestrzeni dla przerażonych pasażerów!"
"21474","It [BOLD:even has slick tires], for [BOLD:maximum grip]… on a bone-dry drag strip. So they should be… interesting when we hit the beach.","","[BOLD:Ma nawet opony bez bieżnika], żeby [BOLD:zmaksymalizować przyczepność]… na suchutkiej prostej. Ciekawie będzie wypróbować je na plaży."
"21475","Oh yes. [BOLD:Spot-on]! Lightning reactions, quick hands.","","[BOLD:Właśnie tak]! Błyskawiczne odruchy, szybkie ręce."
"21476","[BOLD:Holding a drift] is a [BOLD:delicate balance] of [BOLD:throttle, steering] and shouting.","","[BOLD:Kluczem do udanego driftu] jest utrzymanie [BOLD:delikatnej równowagi] pomiędzy [BOLD:dodawaniem gazu, sterownością] i wrzeszczeniem."
"21477","Just goes to show, [BOLD:you can slide almost anything] if you know how. Even a taxi.","","Jak widać, [BOLD:można ślizgać się wszystkim], jeśli tylko wie się jak. Nawet taksówką."
"21478","I [BOLD:called a cab] earlier, a local company, [BOLD:Isha’s Taxis]. Excellent service. [BOLD:Got me here in no time]. Unsurprising really. I mean, just [BOLD:look at what turned up]! Hands-down the [BOLD:quickest cab] I’ve [BOLD:ever been in]. Which got me thinking: [BOLD:how fast could this] thing [BOLD:actually go]?","","[BOLD:Zamówiłem taryfę] z miejscowej firmy, ''[BOLD:Taksówki Ishy]''. Wyśmienita obsługa. [BOLD:Dowieźli mnie tu w mgnieniu oka]. I nic dziwnego. [BOLD:Spójrzcie tylko, co wysłali]! To zdecydowanie [BOLD:najszybsza taksówka], jaką [BOLD:kiedykolwiek jechałem]. Zacząłem się więc zastanawiać, [BOLD:ile może wyciągnąć]?"
"21479","Oh I see, the [BOLD:Stig’s warming up the tires]. A good old-fashioned rolling burnout. We ordered some spare rubber, right?","","Aha, już rozumiem. [BOLD:Stig rozgrzewa opony]. Stare dobre palenie gumy. Mamy zapasowe opony, prawda?"
"21480","The [BOLD:acceleration is insane]. Hope that meter charges by the minute, this could be a cheap ride!","","[BOLD:Obłędne przyspieszenie]. Mam nadzieje, że taksometr nabija opłatę w oparciu o czas. Jeśli tak jest, to będzie to wyjątkowo tania przejażdżka."
"21481","Those [BOLD:tires must be warm now]. I’m surprised they’re still in one piece, to be honest.","","[BOLD:Opony powinny być już rozgrzane]. Szczerze, to jestem zaskoczony, że nadal nie pękły."
"21482","Perfect! [BOLD:Sideways in a taxi]! Once you get it sliding, the throttle is like a second steering wheel.","","Idealnie! [BOLD:Bokiem taksówką]! Gdy już wpadnie w poślizg, dodawanie gazu działa niczym druga kierownica."
"21483","[BOLD:Almost there] now. Lovely sleepy village, this. Absolutely nothing to disturb the peace.","","[BOLD:Już prawie dojechaliśmy]. Cudownie ospała osada. Absolutnie nic nie zakłóca tu spokoju."
"21484","A [BOLD:five-star ride] from the Stig there. Mini cab, maximum speed. Next time I need a ride to the airport, I know who I’m calling. And [BOLD:all of this] off-road action has [BOLD:given me an idea]…","","[BOLD:Mistrzowska jazda] Stiga. Mała taksówka, wielka prędkość. Gdy następnym razem będę spieszył się na lotnisko, dobrze wiem, po kogo dzwonić. Hm, [BOLD:ta terenowa jazda] nasunęła mi [BOLD:pewien pomysł]…"
"21485","Look at that! Laying some [BOLD:pretty squirmy tracks there], Stig. That’s what [BOLD:happens with 750 horsepower on sand]. But that’s the challenge here. Go as [BOLD:fast as possible] all the way [BOLD:to the top of the beach]. The thing is, there’s something I haven’t told the Stig…","","Spójrzcie! [BOLD:Wiercisz niezłe ślady], Stig. Tak właśnie [BOLD:działa 750 koni mechanicznych na piasku]. Niemniej jest to spore wyzwanie. Dotrzeć [BOLD:jak najszybciej] do [BOLD:końca plaży]. Ale o jednym Stigowi nie powiedziałem…"
"21486","So here we are then. In the old days, [BOLD:daredevils used] smooth, sandy [BOLD:beaches like this] to [BOLD:see how fast their cars] could go. Many [BOLD:early land speed records] were [BOLD:set on beaches]. Miles of space, nothing to hit. Sounds easy, right?","","Oto jesteśmy. Dawniej [BOLD:brawurowi śmiałkowie] sprawdzali na takich równych [BOLD:piaszczystych plażach] [BOLD:prędkość swoich wozów]. Wiele [BOLD:wczesnych rekordów prędkości] [BOLD:bito właśnie na plażach]. Kilometry przestrzeni i brak jakichkolwiek przeszkód. Łatwe zadanie, nieprawdaż?"
"21487","[BOLD:Land speed record rules] say you [BOLD:must do two runs]: one in [BOLD:each direction], before the clock runs out. Which [BOLD:means pulling off] the world’s [BOLD:swiftest U-turn]. Which of course is when [BOLD:handbrakes come in handy]…","","[BOLD:Zasady bicia rekordów prędkości na lądzie mówią], że [BOLD:trzeba przejechać] jeden odcinek [BOLD:w obu kierunkach] bez zatrzymywania stopera. [BOLD:Będziemy] zatem potrzebować [BOLD:rekordowego nawrotu]. Tu przydaje się [BOLD:hamulec ręczny]…"
"21488","Onto the [BOLD:final stretch now]. [BOLD:Just] the small matter of [BOLD:getting up Arthur’s Seat]. The clock’s ticking, so better [BOLD:step on it], Stiggy.","","[BOLD:Ostatni odcinek]. [BOLD:Pozostaje] tylko, bagatela, [BOLD:zdobycie wzgórza Arthur’s Seat]. Czas ucieka, więc daj lepiej [BOLD:gaz do dechy], Stiggy."
"21489","[BOLD:Watch out here]. I bet nobody checked the train timetable. Does anybody check train timetables anymore?","","[BOLD:Uważaj]. Na pewno nikt nie sprawdził rozkładu pociągów. Czy ktoś w ogóle jeszcze je sprawdza?"
"21490","Aaaand [BOLD:there we go]: the [BOLD:top of Arthur’s Seat]! No idea who Arthur is, by the way. Or why his seat’s so big. Nice view though. Shame there’s no time to stick around.","","[BOLD:Mamy to]! [BOLD:Szczyt wzgórza Arthur’s Seat]! A tak przy okazji, nie mam pojęcia, o jakiego Arthura chodzi. Ani jak trafił tak wysoko. Ale niezły stąd widok. Szkoda tylko, że nie mamy czasu, aby się nim nacieszyć."
"21491","The E-AT has a [BOLD:silky-smooth V6 diesel]. It’ll do [BOLD:155mph on the road]. But where we’re going, we won’t need roads. [BOLD:First up], it’s a trip to the [BOLD:top of Glen Rannoch], by any means necessary. And [BOLD:against the clock], naturally. But [BOLD:don’t worry]. It [BOLD:has knobbly tires]. And a roof rack, for carrying extra knobbly tires.","","Silnik E-AT to [BOLD:gładziutko chodzący diesel V6]. [BOLD:Na szosie osiąga prędkość 250 km/h]. Ale tam, dokąd jedziemy, nie będziemy potrzebować szos. [BOLD:Zaczniemy] od wyprawy [BOLD:na szczyt Glen Rannoch]. Musimy tam dotrzeć za wszelką cenę. No i zrobimy to [BOLD:na czas], ma się rozumieć. [BOLD:Bez obaw]. E-AT ma [BOLD:opony z kolcami]. A do tego stelaż na dachu na zapasowe ogumienie."
"21492","That’s a [BOLD:four-wheel-drive car], on [BOLD:mud tires], completely [BOLD:sideways]. You’d do well in rallying with skills like that. [BOLD:Top-drawer drifting], I reckon.","","Widzimy tu [BOLD:wóz z napędem na cztery terenowe koła] jadący [BOLD:bokiem]. Z takimi umiejętnościami musisz spróbować swoich sił w rajdach. [BOLD:Najwyższych lotów drift]."
"21493","Who says you need an SUV to go off-road? The [BOLD:E-AT has four-wheel-drive], and [BOLD:air suspension] to [BOLD:smooth out lumps and bumps] and everyday obstacles. Ancient burial mounds, for example.","","Jazda w terenie to nie tylko SUV-y. [BOLD:E-AT ma napęd na cztery koła] i [BOLD:pneumatyczne zawieszenie] [BOLD:amortyzujące wertepy, wyboje] i inne dobrze wszystkim znane przeszkody. Na przykład prastare kurhany."
"21494","It also has [BOLD:340 horsepower], [BOLD:more torque than] a [BOLD:cruise ship], and gets to [BOLD:60mph] in [BOLD:just over five seconds].","","[BOLD:340 koni mechanicznych] i [BOLD:więcej momentu obrotowego] od [BOLD:statku pasażerskiego]. Przyspiesza [BOLD:do setki] w [BOLD:nieco ponad pięć sekund]."
"21495","It’s [BOLD:full of home comforts], the E-AT. [BOLD:Chargers] for almost anything you can charge. Cosy [BOLD:ambient lighting]. Even a [BOLD:portable espresso machine]. Everything the intrepid explorer could ever need.","","[BOLD:E-AT ma mnóstwo udogodnień]. Jak w domu. [BOLD:Ładowarki] do niemal wszystkiego, co można ładować. [BOLD:Nastrojowe oświetlenie] wnętrza. Nawet [BOLD:przenośny ekspres do kawy]. Wszystko to, czego życzyłby sobie nieustraszony poszukiwacz przygód."
"21496","Alright, all this adventure kit has had a tiny effect on the fuel efficiency. Good job the roof rack holds two jerry cans of diesel, and there’s another one in the back. Just don’t confuse them with your drinking water.","","Cała ta wędrowna wyprawka ma wpływ na zużycie paliwa. Na szczęście na stelażu dachowym mieszczą się dwa kanistry, a jeszcze jeden można umocować z tyłu. Byle nie pomylić ich ze zbiornikiem na wodę pitną."
"21497","OHHH, [BOLD:nice drive]. Right down the middle of the fairway.","","[BOLD:Niezła jazda]! Samym środkiem szlaku."
"21498","This is [BOLD:Project E-AT]. That’s E-AT for [BOLD:E Class All Terrain]. It’s a [BOLD:modified Merc], [BOLD:built by] the [BOLD:Top Gear magazine] team for finding bears in the woods. Not many bears around here though. Mostly badgers. Still, there’s definitely some terrain. Lots of it. All [BOLD:you need] is a [BOLD:good sense of direction.]  Or… not. Here’s Stig again, looking lost. Terrified of maps, apparently. Inner compass points directly south.","","Oto [BOLD:projekt E-AT]. Skrót od [BOLD:E Class All Terrain], czyli terenówki klasy E. Jest to [BOLD:skonstruowany przez zespół Top Gear] [BOLD:zmodyfikowany Merc] do wywoływania wilków z lasu. Niestety nie ma ich tu zbyt wiele. To raczej rewir borsuków. Za to mamy tu mnóstwo wyzwań dla terenówki. [BOLD:Przyda się dobry zmysł orientacji]… Jeśli się go ma. Oto raz jeszcze Stig. Wygląda na zagubionego. Podobno przerażają go mapy. Jego kompas biologiczny wskazuje wprost na południe."
"21499","Now that [BOLD:really is off road]. It’s almost off the planet.","","To nie tylko [BOLD:jazda pozaszosowa], ale niemal pozaziemska."
"21500","I see what’s happening here. [BOLD:Engage launch control]…","","Już rozumiem, co tu się wyrabia. [BOLD:Przygotowania do startu]…"
"21501","Now that’s [BOLD:some proper hang time]. Actual air suspension.","","To dopiero [BOLD:porządne zawieszenie]. W powietrzu."
"21502","[BOLD:Now] it’s time to [BOLD:head way over] there, to the very [BOLD:top of Arthur’s Seat]. But first, what goes up must come down…","","[BOLD:Czas] wspiąć się [BOLD:na sam szczyt] wzgórza [BOLD:Arthur’s Seat]. Ale najpierw… Wszystko, co na górze, musi w końcu spaść…"
"21503","Well it is a [BOLD:Mercedes wagon]. So [BOLD:it’s tough]. And if you really want to smash stuff up, there’s even an on-board pickaxe.","","To [BOLD:Mercedes kombi], co oznacza, że [BOLD:jest twardy]. Jeśli zechcesz coś porozwalać na poważnie, to ma też kilof na pokładzie."
"21504","Aaaand [BOLD:here we are]. I told you it was spacious.","","[BOLD:Jesteśmy na miejscu]! Mówiłem, że będzie przestrzennie."
"21505","The Mini is cleverly packaged. Capable of carrying four people and their luggage. Hand luggage, presumably.","","W Mini zastosowano sprytne rozwiązania przestrzenne. Wóz mieści cztery osoby wraz z ich bagażem. Podręcznym, jak mniemam."
"21506","The [BOLD:Cooper S] was THE [BOLD:car to beat] on the famous [BOLD:Monte Carlo rally]. It pretty much wiped the floor with the competition.","","[BOLD:Cooper S] był [BOLD:niezwyciężony] w słynnych [BOLD:rajdach Monte Carlo]. Praktycznie miażdżył swoją konkurencję."
"21507","The [BOLD:Cooper S] was [BOLD:developed by] a bloke called [BOLD:John Cooper], who [BOLD:also built F1 cars]. So it had real racing pedigree.","","Samochód [BOLD:Cooper S] to [BOLD:dzieło] niejakiego [BOLD:Johna Coopera], który [BOLD:pracował też nad bolidami F1]. Jest więc to pojazd o prawdziwie wyścigowym rodowodzie."
"21508","And it [BOLD:wasn’t just Monte Carlo] either. The [BOLD:British Saloon Car Championship], the [BOLD:1000 Lakes Rally], even the [BOLD:Australian Touring Car Championship]… Almost anytime the Mini turned up, it won.","","[BOLD:Triumfował nie tylko w Monte Carlo], ale też w [BOLD:British Saloon Car Championship], [BOLD:Rajdzie Tysiąca Jezior], a nawet w [BOLD:Australian Touring Car Championship]… Mini wygrywał prawie wszędzie, gdzie się pojawiał."
"21509","Now I said we’d be [BOLD:driving some British classics]. And you [BOLD:don’t get more British] than a car [BOLD:built in Birmingham] and designed by a man from, er, Greece.  Anyway. Here it is: an [BOLD:original Mini Cooper S], an [BOLD:icon of Sixties engineering]. It was designed for cities. But this is the wide body one, so we’re going to need a bit more… room. And I know just the place. Ready, Stig?","","A zatem przejedziemy się dzisiaj [BOLD:brytyjskimi klasykami]. A cóż może być [BOLD:bardziej brytyjskiego] od samochodu [BOLD:zbudowanego w Birmingham] i zaprojektowanego przez faceta z… Co? Z Grecji? W każdym razie, oto i on. [BOLD:Oryginalny Mini Cooper S] — [BOLD:ikona inżynierii lat 60]. Zaprojektowano go z myślą o jeździe w mieście. Ale ten egzemplarz ma poszerzone nadwozie, więc przyda nam się nieco więcej… przestrzeni. Znam doskonałe miejsce. Gotów, Stig?"
"21510","Back in the day, a [BOLD:Mini Cooper finished third] in the world’s [BOLD:first ever rallycross race]. So it could handle rough roads too. Might even slide a bit.","","[BOLD:Mini Cooper zajął też trzecie miejsce] na pierwszym w historii [BOLD:wyścigu rallycrossowym]. Radził więc sobie na trudnych drogach. Być może nieco się nawet po nich ślizgał."
"21511","[BOLD:Good work]. It might be mini on the outside, but it’s [BOLD:maxi on the inside]. Wanna guess the [BOLD:world record] for the [BOLD:most people crammed inside] one? I’ll tell you: it’s [BOLD:27… Gymnasts]. No idea if they all came out in one piece.","","[BOLD:Dobra robota]. Może i Mini z wyglądu, ale ma [BOLD:maksi serducho]. Chcecie poznać [BOLD:rekord] liczby [BOLD:osób upakowanych do środka]? [BOLD:27… gimnastyczek]. Nie wiem, czy udało im się wyjść w całości czy w kawałkach."
"21512","See, the [BOLD:Mini wasn’t just] designed for [BOLD:nipping around town]. It was also [BOLD:a proper racer], and [BOLD:won] the [BOLD:British saloon car championship] a whopping [BOLD:five times].","","[BOLD:Mini zaprojektowano nie tylko do śmigania po mieście]. Ten wóz był też rajdówką z [BOLD:prawdziwego zdarzenia]. Pięciokrotnym [BOLD:zwycięzcą British Saloon Car Championship]. To niesamowite osiągnięcie."
"21513","Yes! [BOLD:THAT’s what] the [BOLD:Mini is all about]. No wonder it was [BOLD:pretty much unbeatable]. Maybe that’s why its [BOLD:basic design lasted] for [BOLD:over 40 years].","","Tak! [BOLD:Właśnie to jest sednem Mini]. Nic dziwnego, że był [BOLD:praktycznie niepokonany]. Może właśnie dlatego przez [BOLD:ponad 40 lat] nie zmieniono jego [BOLD:podstawowej budowy]."
"21514","They sold nearly five and a half million Minis. But only this one could fly, apparently.","","Spośród blisko pięciu i pół miliona egzemplarzy Mini, które sprzedano, najwyraźniej tylko ten potrafi latać."

"21516","Look at that… [BOLD:laying down some rubber there]. Not that it has much to lay. After all, tiny wheels mean tiny tires.","","Spójrzcie tylko na to. [BOLD:Spala tam nieco gumy]. A nie ma wiele do spalenia. Maleńkie koła oznaczają maleńkie opony."
"21517","Now [BOLD:that’s just showing off]. What is it with Minis and shipping containers?","","[BOLD:To już czysta popisówka]. O co chodzi z tymi Mini i kontenerami?"
"21518","[BOLD:Lovely work] there. [BOLD:Short wheelbase, front-wheel-drive]. It’s really not an easy car to slide, this.","","[BOLD:Piękna robota]. [BOLD:Wąski rozstaw osi, napęd na przednie koła]. Zdecydowanie nie jest to łatwy pojazd do kontrolowanych poślizgów."
"21519","We’ve got [BOLD:everything we need] here: an [BOLD:airfield], the [BOLD:original rapid runabout], and [BOLD:the Stig]. I’m looking forward to this.","","[BOLD:Mamy wszystko], czego nam trzeba: [BOLD:lotnisko], [BOLD:oryginalną wersję szybkiej wyścigówki] i [BOLD:Stiga]. Nie mogę się już doczekać."

Pomoże nam w tym ten [BOLD:potężny model Porsche GT2 RS]. Potrzeba nam już tylko [BOLD:przewodnika wycieczki]. [BOLD:Stig ''Waleczne Serce''] — najbardziej niewydarzony Szkot świata. Z tego, co słyszałem, jest uczulony na szkocką kratę i przerażają go dudy."
"21524","Oof. [BOLD:Inch-perfect] there. It’s [BOLD:wider than a regular 911], this GT2. And about [BOLD:20 times more terrifying]. Basically the perfect device for nipping in and out of city traffic.","","[BOLD:Chirurgiczna precyzja]. GT2 jest [BOLD:szerszy od standardowego modelu 911] i około [BOLD:20 razy bardziej przerażający]. Idealna maszyna do wskakiwania i wyskakiwania w miejskim ruchu."
"21525","[BOLD:Excellent hooliganry]! That’s what 700 horsepower and rear wheel drive will do for you. If you have the guts for it. And an effective laundry detergent.","","[BOLD:Wyborne chuligaństwo]! Oto ile można narozrabiać przy 700 koniach mechanicznych i napędzie na tylne koła. Jeśli ma się odwagę… i skuteczny proszek do prania."
"21526","What a car this is. [BOLD:3.8 liter flat-six, two turbos, 700 horsepower]. All wrapped up in [BOLD:carbon fiber], with [BOLD:wings, stripes, holes and vents] for [BOLD:snorting in the air].","","Co za maszyna! [BOLD:Silnik 3,8 litra, 6-cylindrowy bokser, podwójne turbodoładowanie, 700 koni mechanicznych]. Opakowany we [BOLD:włókna węglowe]. [BOLD:Ze skrzydłami, paskami, dziurkami i przewodami do wciągania powietrza]."
"21527","Nippy little thing, isn’t it? [BOLD:Zero to sixty] takes [BOLD:2.7 seconds]. Just the job for a bit of speedy sightseeing.","","Zrywne maleństwo, czyż nie? [BOLD:Od zera do setki w 2,7 sekundy]. W sam raz na ekspresowe zwiedzanie."
"21528","It might be [BOLD:street legal], but it’s only a pair of fireproof pants away from being a full-blown racing car.","","Choć [BOLD:dopuszczony do ruchu ulicznego], do wyścigówki z prawdziwego zdarzenia brakuje mu tylko ognioodpornych portek dla kierowcy."
"21529","It’s a real [BOLD:masterpiece of engineering], this GT2 RS. The [BOLD:wheels are] made from [BOLD:magnesium]. The [BOLD:exhaust is titanium]. It’s exotic, savage, and utterly bonkers. I love it!","","GT2 RS to [BOLD:istne arcydzieło inżynierii]. [BOLD:Koła] z [BOLD:magnezu], [BOLD:wydech] z [BOLD:tytanu]. Egzotyczny, nieokrzesany i nieziemsko wyczesany. Uwielbiam go!"
"21530","It’s [BOLD:limited to 211] mph. Any faster and it would need special tires. But with the Stig behind the wheel, who knows…","","Ma [BOLD:ogranicznik prędkości do 340 km/h]. Aby jechać szybciej, potrzebowałby specjalnych opon. Ale ze Stigiem za kółkiem, kto wie…"
"21531","Into the [BOLD:final stretch now]. Note to Stig: remember to [BOLD:park properly at the end]. And watch out for traffic wardens.","","[BOLD:Ostatni odcinek]. Uwaga dla Stiga: pamiętaj, aby [BOLD:na koniec poprawnie zaparkować] i uważać na drogówkę."
"21532","[BOLD:Good job], Big Rig Stig. Suits you, you know. Although come to think of it, maybe pickups are more your style. Especially the one we have in store…","","[BOLD:Dobra robota], ''Podnośniku'' Stigu. To twój styl. Choć chyba jeszcze lepiej pasują ci półciężarówki. Szczególnie takie jak ta, którą mamy w zanadrzu…"
"21533","Right, now [BOLD:take it easy Stig]. That’s some [BOLD:expensive cargo] you have back there. Costs as much as a house, and weighs about the same, too.","","[BOLD:Ostrożnie, Stig]. Wieziesz [BOLD:cenny ładunek]. Kosztuje tyle co dom. Waży też mniej więcej tyle samo."
"21534","Have you [BOLD:guessed what it is] yet? OK, here are [BOLD:some cryptic clues]. It’s [BOLD:all-wheel-drive], but [BOLD:not four-wheel-drive]. It’s a wagon, but you definitely don’t need a horse to pull it. Hmm.","","Czy już [BOLD:zgadliście, co to jest]? Dam wam [BOLD:zawiłe wskazówki]. [BOLD:Napęd na wszystkie koła], ale [BOLD:nie na cztery]. Wielki jak furmanka, ale nie potrzebuje konia. Hm?"
"21535","That’s [BOLD:five tons of flatbed] carrying [BOLD:four tons on its back]. Don’t you just hate getting stuck behind a slow, lumbering old…  Wait a minute. It’s [BOLD:actually accelerating]. [BOLD:Up a hill]. I guess that’s what [BOLD:900 lb ft of torque] does for you. That, [BOLD:plus trucker Stig].","","To [BOLD:pięciotonowa platforma] wioząca [BOLD:czterotonowy ładunek]. Nie ma to jak utknąć za wleczącym się, starym… Chwileczkę. [BOLD:Przyspiesza]. I to [BOLD:na podjeździe]. Cóż, wszak ma ponad [BOLD:1200 niutonometrów momentu obrotowego]… Oraz Stiga za kółkiem."
"21536","Almost there. [BOLD:Just park it up] and we’ll whip those covers off.","","Jesteśmy już prawie na miejscu. [BOLD:Zaparkuj] i zdejmujemy plandekę."
"21537","I told you we’d finish with [BOLD:a fans’ favourite]. And here it is! No, [BOLD:not the lorry]. The thing on the back, [BOLD:under the tarp]. You’ll love it. But first we [BOLD:need to move it into position]. Thankfully we have our very own haulage expert. A trucker’s trucker. No load too large. Yes, it’s Big Rig Stig.","","Przypominam, że dzisiejszy odcinek zakończymy spotkaniem z [BOLD:ulubieńcem fanów]. Oto i on! Nie, [BOLD:nie chodzi mi o tę ciężarówkę], tylko o to, co jest z tyłu, [BOLD:pod plandeką]. Spodoba wam się. Ale najpierw [BOLD:zawieźmy go na miejsce]. Na szczęście mamy ze sobą naszego eksperta od przewozów. Majstra nad majstrami, dla którego nie ma zbyt dużych ładunków. Tak, to ''Podnośnik'' Stig."
"21538","Nicely judged. [BOLD:What a machine]! Rear-wheel-drive too, you know. Not that I’d encourage any sort of sideways behaviour before delivering that cargo…","","Niezła robota. [BOLD:Co za maszyna]! Napęd na tylne koła. Nie żebym zachęcał do jakiegokolwiek driftu przed dowiezieniem ładunku…"
"21539","It makes [BOLD:536 horsepower], and more than [BOLD:760 newton metres of torque]. With that speed limiter removed, and with Stig behind the wheel, it [BOLD:will do 125 mph], with a bit of a run up.","","[BOLD:536 koni mechanicznych] i ponad [BOLD:760 niutonometrów momentu obrotowego]. Z wymontowanym ogranicznikiem, Stigiem za kółkiem i małym rozbiegiem na pewno [BOLD:rozpędzi się do 200 km/h]."
"21540","It can [BOLD:wade through] a [BOLD:meter of water], this thing. Most cars need full scuba kit at that depth. Ridiculous.","","Może [BOLD:jechać w wodzie głębokiej na metr]. Większość samochodów potrzebowałoby do tego akwalungu. Obłęd."
"21541","With all of the wheels comes all of the grip. The [BOLD:6x6 turns mountains into motorways]. Is there anything it can’t conquer?","","Taka przyczepność to zasługa tych wszystkich kół. [BOLD:6x6 zamienia góry w autostrady]. Dla tego potwora nie istnieją żadne przeszkody."
"21542","Someone [BOLD:call air traffic control]. I’m pretty sure you need a special license to fly one of these.","","Niech ktoś zadzwoni do [BOLD:kontroli ruchu lotniczego]. Na pewno potrzeba nam specjalnego pozwolenia na taki lot."
"21543","[BOLD:Top job there, Stig]. Take tomorrow off. No idea what Stig does with a day off. Experimental dance? Goat yoga? Bog snorkling? Anyway. [BOLD:I’ve been Chris Harris]. I still am. And [BOLD:this] has been the [BOLD:Top Gear Horizon Special]. Thanks for coming. Now, let’s go see what this Forzathon Live thing is all about…","","[BOLD:Świetna robota, Stig]. Weź sobie jutro wolne, z pewnością znajdziesz fajne zajęcie. Taniec eksperymentalny? Joga z kozami? Nurkowanie w bagnie? Nie wiem, na czym polega wolne Stiga. Tak czy siak, [BOLD:nazywam się Chris Harris], a wy [BOLD:oglądaliście] [BOLD:odcinek specjalny Top Gear] z [BOLD:Wyścigu specjalnego Horizon]. Dziękujemy za uwagę. A teraz chodźmy zobaczyć, o co chodzi z tym całym Forzathon Live…"
"21544","Up front is a [BOLD:5.5-liter, twin-turbo V8]. Usually it’s limited to 100mph, but not this one…","","Z przodu [BOLD:silnik 5,5 litra, podwójne turbo V8]. Standardowe egzemplarze mają ograniczenie prędkości do 160 km/h, ale nie ten tutaj…"
"21545","How did you do that? It’s six meters long! That’s [BOLD:like drifting a canal boat].","","Jak to możliwe? Przecież ten wóz ma sześć metrów długości! To jak [BOLD:drift barką]."
"21546","I give you the [BOLD:Mercedes G63 AMG 6x6]. It’s the ultimate off-roader: a [BOLD:four-ton, six-wheel Sports Utility Truck]. Basically a G Wagon with the back half of a pickup thrown in for free.","","Oto [BOLD:Mercedes G63 AMG 6x6]. Największe osiągnięcie technologii terenowej: [BOLD:czterotonowa, sześciokołowa półciężarówka SUV]. Właściwie jest to kombi klasy G, któremu doczepiono drugą połowę w postaci tyłu od półciężarówki."
"21547","It's tough, [BOLD:the 6x6]. After all, it was originally [BOLD:made for] the [BOLD:Australian Army]. It's basically a [BOLD:tank, with heated seats].","","[BOLD:6x6] to twardziel. Wszak pierwotnie [BOLD:zaprojektowano go] z myślą o [BOLD:australijskiej armii]. To w zasadzie [BOLD:czołg z podgrzewanymi fotelami]."
"21548","Anyhow, I think we’re picking up my mate Charlie next. Maybe he’s got something good.","","W każdym razie zaraz podjedziemy po mojego kolegę Charliego. Może on coś będzie miał."
"21549","Oh. Well, there’s not much point doing the rest of the joke now you’ve heard the punchline. Sorry, name’s Jess, by the way. Just warming up for this gig in Edinburgh—hope you don’t mind.","","A, rozumiem. Nie ma co opowiadać reszty kawału, jeśli znasz już puentę. Przy okazji, nazywam się Jess. Tak się rozgrzewam przed tym występem w Edynburgu, nie masz chyba nic przeciwko?"
"21550","See, there’s so many people in town for the Horizon Festival I figure I’d better do some car jokes, but I don’t know any. Do you? You’re a driver.","","Wiesz, tyle ludzi przyjechało do miasta na festiwal Horizon, że chyba powinnam opowiadać jakieś dowcipy samochodowe, ale żadnych nie znam. A ty? Jesteś przecież kierowcą."
"21551","Nothing, eh? See, this is exactly what I mean. Joking about cars with this Horizon lot is like joking about burgers with a bunch of cows.","","Nic, naprawdę? No właśnie o to mi chodzi. Opowiadać kawały o samochodach przed tym całym tłumem z Horizon, to jak żartować o burgerach przed stadem krów."
"21552","Nothing, eh? You know, for a cabby you certainly don’t say much.","","Nic, naprawdę? Wiesz, jak na taksówkarza, to nie jesteś zbyt rozmowny."
"21553","… and the bloke looks at the mechanic and says “I’d love to but that’s not my car!” Ahahah…  What d’you reckon?","","...a gostek patrzy na mechanika im mówi „Chętnie, ale to nie mój samochód!”. Hahahaha… Czaisz?"
"21554","You wanna know how slow my car is? I’ll tell you how slow my car is, my car’s so slow that… oh, is that you Jess? Ayup. How you doing? Got your car material ready for the gig? Not really, Charlie. What have you got? Sounds like you’re working on something. Yeah, here, listen to this… my car’s so slow that when I drive it, it often makes me late for stuff. That’s not very good, Charlie. Nah, i’'s not is it. As slow as… blimey, this one driving won’t be much help, this taxi’s quicker than my Mum on bingo night. Here, we’re picking up Harry next, let’s see if he's got summat.","","Chcesz wiedzieć, jak wolny jest mój wóz? No to słuchaj: mój wóz... mój wóz jest wolny jak... o, czy to ty, Jess? Cześć. Jak leci? Masz już ten materiał o samochodach na występ? Nie za bardzo, Charlie. A ty coś wymyśliłeś? Wyglądasz, jakbyś nad czymś pracował. No tak, posłuchaj tego... mój wóz jest tak wolny, że spóźniam się wszędzie tam, gdzie nim pojadę. Spodziewałam się czegoś lepszego, Charlie. Nie, wciąż nad tym pracuję. Jest wolny jak... kurczę, jazda tego tutaj mi nie pomoże, ta taksówka jest szybsza niż staruszka w tramwaju. Teraz zabieramy Harry'ego. Może on coś wymyślił."
"21555","Alright, everyone? What do you call a driver with no sense of direction? Take it easy, Harry, we don’t want to upset our nice Horizon driver in the front here. Besides I know the punchline to that one and it’s rubbish. You do? You could tell me then, I’m still working on the bloomin’ thing. How about you, Jess, what have you got? A whole lot of nothing and not a lot of time to come up with anything better, the rate this taxi’s going. Alright, how about this. What do you call a comedian who has to get a job as a taxi driver? I’d call that you and me, mate, if we don’t come up with something before we get to Edinburgh. Okay okay, calm down. We’re picking up Poppy next, she’s bound to have something.","","Uwaga, słuchajcie! Jak nazywa się kierowca bez zmysłu orientacji? Wyluzuj, Harry. Nie denerwujmy tego miłego kierowcy z Horizon. Poza tym znam puentę tego kawału i jest do niczego. Tak? To może mi ją powiesz, bo wciąż nie mogę nic wymyślić. A ty coś masz, Jess? Całe nic i mało czasu, żeby wymyślić coś lepszego, a taksówka pędzi jak szalona. Dobra, posłuchajcie tego. Jak się nazywa komik, który pracuje jako taksówkarz? Brzmi jak my, jeśli nie wpadniemy na coś przed przyjazdem do Edynburga. Spoko, spoko. Jedziemy teraz po Poppy, ona na pewno coś wymyśli."
"21556","Hi everyone! Jess, Charlie, Harry. Wow, car jokes are hard, right? How about this - why did the Horizon driver cross the road? Yep, we’re doomed. Steady on! I’ve got some other stuff I’ve been working on. Erm… how many Horizon drivers does it take to change a lightbulb? Tried that already. The answer’s one. Tech down in the autoshow named Dave. Changed both headlights on my car in about two seconds flat. Alright, relax everyone! We’re going to pick up Jack before we head to the gig. He’s absolutely hilarious, he’ll definitely have something.","","Cześć wszystkim! Jess, Charlie, Harry. Powiem wam, że żarty o samochodach to ciężka sprawa... To może ten: dlaczego kierowca Horizon przeszedł przez ulicę? Jesteśmy zgubieni. Spokojnie! Mam jeszcze inne. Ehm... Ilu kierowców Horizon potrzeba, aby zmienić żarówkę? Już tego próbowałam. Odpowiedź to jeden. Mechanik o imieniu Dave w salonie. Zmienił oba światła w moim samochodzie w jakieś dwie sekundy. No dobra, spokój! Przed występem jedziemy jeszcze po Jacka. On jest taki zabawny, że na pewno coś wymyśli."
"21557","Hello Jess, Charlie, Harry, Poppy. Fancy running into all of you. Wow this taxi is quite fast isn’t it. Are we all excited for the gig. I know I am. Jack, you have to help us, we’re dying here. Seriously, Jack! With all these Horizon people in town if we can’t come up with a decent car joke we’re going to get laughed off the stage! Like, not in a good way. Come on, Jack, we’re all counting on you, what have you got for us? Don’t worry, I've got it under control. You ready. When is a car not a car. When it turns into a corner. Alright, it’s going to be a great show everyone. Thank you very much, driver.","","Cześć, Jess, Charlie, Harry, Poppy. Świetnie was wszystkich widzieć. Ale ta taksówka jest szybka. Chyba wszyscy nie możemy się już doczekać występu. Przynajmniej ja. Jack, musisz nam pomóc albo będzie po nas. Serio, Jack! W mieście roi się od ludzi z Horizon, a jak nie wpadniemy na jakiś dobry kawał o samochodach, to nas wyśmieją na scenie! I to nie z radości. Dawaj, Jack, wszyscy na ciebie liczymy, masz coś? Nie martwcie się, mam wszystko pod kontrolą. Jesteście gotowi? Co robi stary rzęch w zakładzie fryzjerskim? Warkocze! No to zapowiada się świetny show. Bardzo dziękujemy, panie kierowco."
"21558","Hey, how are ya? I’m so excited to get to Horizon UK. I went to Horizon Australia and it was amazing. Have you been to the Festival yourself? … Not a talker, eh? That’s OK.","","Hej, jak się masz? Tak się cieszę, że jadę na Horizon UK. Byłam na Horizon Australia i było wspaniale. To twój pierwszy raz na festiwalu? ... Nie gadasz zbyt wiele, co? Nie ma sprawy."
"21559","G’day, how are ya? I’m so excited to get to Horizon UK. I went to Horizon Australia and it was amazing. Have you been to the Festival yourself? … Not a talker, eh? That’s OK.","","Cześć, jak się masz? Tak się cieszę, że jadę na Horizon UK. Byłam na Horizon Australia i było wspaniale. To twój pierwszy raz na festiwalu? ... Nie gadasz zbyt wiele, co? Nie ma sprawy."
"21560","Wow, how long did that take? You’re not a talker but you sure can drive. Thanks a lot, mate. See you round.","","Oho, ile to trwało? Nie gadasz zbyt wiele, ale z pewnością umiesz prowadzić. Dzięki. Na razie."
"21561","Crikey, how long did that take? You’re not a talker but you sure can drive. Thanks a lot, mate. See you round like a rissole.","","O rany, ile to trwało? Nie jesteś zbyt rozmowny, ale na pewno umiesz prowadzić. Dzięki, chłopie. Na razie."
"21562","Never been to the UK before. I landed just last night but I’ve gotta say, I reckon I could get used to living here. It’s pretty beautiful around here, isn’t it?","","Jeszcze nigdy nie byłam w Anglii, wylądowałam wczoraj wieczorem i chyba dałabym radę tu zamieszkać. Pięknie tu mają, no nie?"
"21563","Never been to the UK before. I only landed last night but I’d say the main difference between here and Australia so far is that we’re better at everything.","","Jeszcze nigdy nie byłam w Wielkiej Brytanii, wylądowałam dopiero wczoraj wieczorem, ale jak na razie nie widziałam jeszcze nic, co by mi się bardziej podobało niż w Australii."
"21564","Wow, is that the Festival? It’s massive! You mean to tell me that this Festival runs all year round? How do they afford this?!","","Co, to jest ten festiwal? Robi wrażenie! Chcesz mi wmówić, że trwa cały rok? Jak im się to opłaca?"
"21565","Wow, is that the Festival? It’s massive! I take it back, you poms might have actually beaten us at something for a change.","","Co, to jest ten festiwal? Robi wrażenie! Odszczekuję swoje słowa, wy, Brytole, chyba jednak potraficie nas w czymś pobić."
"21566","See, in my day, taxi driving was a calling, not a pastime. Now it’s all smart phones and touch screens though, innit. You’ve got your little satnav there. Let’s see you get me to… Hythe House.","","No wiesz, w moich czasach taksówkarz to był zawód, a nie forma rozrywki. Teraz, z tymi smartfonami to inna sprawa, no nie? Aha, masz GPS. Zobaczymy, czy zawieziesz mnie do... domu w Hythe."
"21567","See, in my day, taxi driving was a calling, not a pastime. Now it’s all smartphones and touch screens though, innit. You’ve got your little satnav there… bet it won’t help!","","No wiesz, za moich czasów taksówkarz to był zawód, a nie forma rozrywki. Teraz, z tymi smartfonami to inna sprawa, no nie? Aha, masz GPS... założę się, że się pomyli!"
"21568","Is this Hythe House? Hehe… is that the time? Blimey, well… guess you did alright then, dincha? If you’re ever down in London… don’t try to pinch any of my fares. Eh, eh? Hahahaha.","","Czy to jest Hythe House? Tak wcześnie? Tam do licha, rzeczywiście dajesz radę! Jeśli kiedyś będziesz w Londynie... nawet nie próbuj podbierać mi pasażerów. Jasne? Ha, ha, ha."
"21569","Is this the place? And is that the time? Blimey, well… guess you did alright then, dincha? If you’re ever down in London… don’t try to pinch any of my fares.","","Już jesteśmy na miejscu? Tak wcześnie? Tam do licha, rzeczywiście dajesz radę! Jeśli kiedyś będziesz w Londynie... nawet nie próbuj podbierać mi pasażerów."
"21570","Going a bit fast, incha? I mean, I go through London traffic like a hot knife through butter, but I’ve got the skill and the experience, don’t I?","","Nie pędzisz aby za szybko? Tak tylko pytam, bo cię nie znam. Jak ktoś to potrafi, i jeździł tyle, co ja, to nawet nie poczuje, że w Londynie są korki."
"21571","Nah, see, you shoulda taken a turn back there. What did I tell ya? These gadgets and gizmos are never gonna replace good old-fashioned know how… Oh, hold on… Yeh, this is still the right way.","","No tak, trzeba było skręcić tam. Przecież mówiłam, że te wszystkie gadżety i sprzęty nie zastąpią zdrowego rozsądku... eee, czekaj. Tak, to jednak dobra droga."
"21572","Tell you what I like about your office, though. Nice motor, spacious, comfy. Five-point seatbelts. Very swank.","","Wiesz co, ale gablotę to masz niczego sobie. Niezły silnik. Dużo miejsca, wygoda. Pięciopunktowe pasy. Bajerzasta."
"21573","Hiya. I’m headed for a house on Derwentwater please. First day and night at the Festival have been incredible. Now it’s time for the afterparty.","","Czołem. Chcę dojechać na domek przy Derwentwater. Pierwszy dzień i noc na festiwalu były niesamowite. Teraz czas na afterparty."
"21574","Thank you so much. Have a great Festival. Here, I’m giving you a five-star review right now. If it went higher than that, I would.","","Wielkie dzięki. Baw się dobrze na Festiwalu. Dam ci zaraz pięć gwiazdek. Szkoda, że nie można więcej."
"21575","Oh, you’re not the driver with the bad review, are you? I was hoping I’d get you! Too fast, too slick, and no talking. Sounds like the best taxi ride ever for a Londoner! Let’s go!","","To ty jesteś tym kierowcą ze złą opinią? Miałam nadzieję, że cię znajdę! Zbyt szybko, zbyt niebezpiecznie i nic nie mówi? Tego właśnie potrzeba każdemu Londyńczykowi. Jedziemy!"
"21576","That was fantastic! I came to Horizon for the music… had no idea I’d actually get to race as well.","","Ho, ho, super! Przyjechałam na Horizon posłuchać muzyki, a nie wiedziałam, że będą też wyścigi."
"21577","Jess? It’s me! Remember that hilarious Isha’s Taxis review we read? I got that driver! Yeah! You’re at the party? Cool, I’ll be there in… I dunno, about ten seconds at this rate. Hehe.","","Jess? To ja! Pamiętasz tę śmieszną opinię o Usługach Taksówkarskich Ishy, którą czytaliśmy? Mam tego kierowcę! Jesteś już na imprezie? Dobra, to ja będę... w tym tempie to pewnie za dziesięć sekund. He, he."
"21578","I actually cannot believe you just jumped off that. This is amazing!","","Nie wierzę, że udało ci się z tego wyskoczyć. To było genialne!"
"21579","Lovely weather today, she says. How about a walk in the country, she says. No need to take an umbrella, she says. What could possibly go wrong…","","Piękną mamy dzisiaj pogodę, mówiła. Może wybierzemy się na spacer za miasto, mówiła. Po co ci parasol, mówiła, co się może stać..."
"21580","You lot from the Festival like the damp, though, don’t you? Slipping and sliding all over the place.","","Na tym festiwalu to będziecie mieli używanie z tym błotem, co nie? Tyle miejsca, żeby się poślizgać..."
"21581","You know what’s funny? Where I’m from we get rained on about a hundred and fifty days a year. And we’re still surprised when it happens.","","Wiesz, co jest zabawne? Tam, skąd pochodzę, pada średnio sto pięćdziesiąt dni w roku. A i tak zawsze to nas zaskakuje."
"21582","You alright? I’m soaking wet… thanks for asking. And now I’m putting mud all over your nice clean car and… ugh. Can you just take me home to Broadway, please?","","Jak się masz? Ja ociekam wodą od stóp do głów, ale miło, że pytasz. No to teraz ci naniosę błota do twojego czyściutkiego samochodziku... ble. Zawieziesz mnie do Broadway, proszę?"
"21583","I’m going to go inside and have a cup of tea and a very long, very hot bath… Thanks for saving me. You go enjoy the weather. Glad it’s fun for someone.","","Wejdę teraz do środka, napiję się herbaty i wygrzeję się w wannie. Dzięki za ratunek. Ciesz się pogodą. Miło, że komuś się podoba."
"21584","Much obliged for the ride. I know it’s strange and we’re not going far but I was over here for the Festival and I’ve been a fan of drag racing for as long as I can remember, so… gee, Horizon sure is something, ain’t it?","","Wielkie dzięki za podwiezienie. Wiem, że to dziwne, bo to wcale nie było daleko, ale przyjechałem na ten festiwal, bo od dawna jestem fanem wyścigów drag, więc... Horizon to coś dla mnie, co nie?"
"21585","Wow. Can’t wait to get home and tell everyone about this. Not for a while though. I ain’t finished with the Festival yet. Thank you, to you and Joel and everyone.","","No, no. Nie mogę się doczekać, aż wrócę do domu i wszystkim o tym opowiem. Ale to za jakiś czas, bo jeszcze pobawię się na festiwalu. Dziękuję tobie, Joelowi i wszystkim."
"21586","Yeeeehawww!","","Juuuhuuuu!"
"21587","Thanks so much, but… how did you get here so quick? You didn’t know my car was gonna break down before I did, did you?","","Dziękuję, ale... jak ci się udało dojechać tak szybko? Chyba nie wiedziałeś, że akurat teraz zepsuje mi się samochód?"
"21588","Fantastic. I might keep Isha’s Taxis on speed dial and just get rid of the car. It’s always been a bit of a banger anyway.","","Fantastycznie. Może dodam telefon do Taksówek Ishy do ulubionych i pozbędę się samochodu? W sumie to i tak rzęch."
"21589","It’s always like this. Just when you need to get somewhere, a light comes on, and the car stops workin’.","","Zawsze tak jest. Gdy tylko musisz gdzieś dojechać, zapala się lampka i samochód staje."
"21590","It’s almost as if it knows I need to go somewhere, and it’s actively working against me. You don’t… you don’t think that’s what’s actually happenning? Hehe. No, no, of course not!","","Tak jakby doskonale wiedział, że muszę gdzieś zdążyć, i specjalnie mi w tym przeszkadzał... Czy ty... myślisz, że to się dzieje naprawdę? He, he. Nie, nie. Oczywiście, że nie!"
"21591","Sorry to have bothered you but my tractor’s on the blink. And I’m sorry if this is unorthodox but… I know every blade of grass on this farm and I’m a little set in my ways so you’ll follow my shortcut precisely, please… Straight across that field to start.","","Przepraszam, że zawracam głowę, ale mój traktor się zepsuł. I wiem, że to może nieelegancko, ale... Znam każde źdźbło trawy na tej farmie i jestem trochę do nich przyzwyczajona, więc pojedź proszę tym skrótem, który ci pokażę... Na początek, prosto przez to pole."
"21592","There now, wasn’t that a good shortcut? Apologies if it was a little bumpy. A few new blades of grass I’m not yet familiar with, I think.","","No i jak, niezły skrót, co? Przepraszam, jeśli trochę wyboisty. Chyba wyrosło kilka nowych źdźbeł trawy, których jeszcze nie znałam."
"21593","Just past the shed and then you can turn onto the track.","","Tuż za tą szopą możesz wrócić na szosę."
"21594","Through these trees, please. And best keep the throttle up or we’ll never get through.","","Przez te drzewa, proszę. I najlepiej nie spuszczaj nogi z gazu, bo nie przejedziemy."
"21595","Cut across the road now. My shortcut is much quicker.","","Przetnij tę drogę. Moim skrótem będzie o wiele szybciej."
"21596","Through here. I’d put a nice gate in but that would make the shortcut very slightly longer, you see.","","Teraz tędy. Postawiłabym tutaj ładną bramkę, ale wtedy ten skrót byłby dłuższy."
"21597","Across the fields now. My shortcut really is much quicker.","","Przejedź przez te pola. Moim skrótem będzie naprawdę o wiele szybciej."
"21598","Now up along the track and park it out back, next to that useless tractor.","","Teraz dalej po szosie i zaparkuj sobie tam, obok tego beznadziejnego traktora."
"21599","Right, well. Made a bit of a fool of meself, haven’t I? Sorry about the fib I told to get you down here, but thanks for the ride. That was some proper wild driving you just did.","","No, dobrze. Trochę się wygłupiłem. Przepraszam za to, co plotłem wcześniej, i dziękuję za tę dziką jazdę. Naprawdę umiesz się popisać."
"21600","Right, now I’m gonna let you in on a little secret… I don’t actually need to go anywhere. You’ve got a reputation around here as some sort of boss driver. Well, it’s gonna take a lot more than a reputation to impress me. Head for the Mortimer Gardens and bring the drift.","","A teraz zdradzę ci pewien sekrecik... właściwie to nie muszę nigdzie jechać. Ale ty masz reputację i mówią, że jesteś kimś w rodzaju mistrza kierownicy. Na mnie jednak sama reputacja nie robi wrażenia. Pojedź do Ogrodów Mortimera i pokaż, jak driftujesz."
"21601","Er… yeah, alright, that sort of impressed me a bit.","","Eee... no to, to już robi pewne wrażenie."
"21602","Yeah, maybe there’s a reason why you’ve got that reputation then.","","No, może faktycznie twoja reputacja nie wzięła się znikąd."
"21603","Alright, steady on. I know when I’m being made fun of!","","Hola, hola, już ja wiem, kiedy się robi ze mnie jaja!"
"21604","Alright, love? Oh, you’re not one of these drivers from Horizon, are you? I’m from a family of big racing fans myself. My sister and I have been following all the action at the Festival. You couldn’t… put your foot down a bit for me, could you?","","Dobrze, skarbie? Ale ty chyba nie jesteś jednym z tych kierowców z Horizon? Całą rodziną uwielbiamy wyścigi i razem z siostrą śledzimy cały czas, co dzieje się na festiwalu. Czy mógłbyś... dodać troszeczkę gazu, specjalnie dla mnie?"
"21605","Thank you! Good luck racing at the Festival. I’ll be cheering for you! … Wait till I tell my sister I had a ride in a real race car. She’ll say it was only a taxi but you and I know differently, don’t we, love?","","Dziękuję! Powodzenia w wyścigu na festiwalu — będę ci kibicować! Niech tylko moja siostra się dowie, że jechałam prawdziwym wozem wyścigowym. Pewnie stwierdzi, że to tylko taksówka, ale przecież my dwoje wiemy, że było inaczej, co nie, skarbie?"
"21606","That’s not bad but it looks a lot faster on the telly. Can you speed it up a bit?","","Nieźle, ale gdzie ci tam do tych z telewizji. Możesz jeszcze trochę szybciej?"
"21607","Come on, now, love, I want you to really blow my hair back. Can you do that for me?","","Dawaj, skarbie, chcę poczuć ten dreszczyk. Zrobisz to dla mnie?"
"21608","How fast are we going now!? Ha! This is amazing. Everything looks so… blurry right now","","To ile teraz jedziemy?! Hoho! Cudowne uczucie, wszystko wygląda na takie jakby... zamazane."

"36251","[Bold:UNLOCKED BY INSTALLING RACE BRAKE UPGRADES.]<lf><lf>A car’s level of grip and the way it handles weight transfer under acceleration or deceleration affects its brake balance. As you upgrade and tune your car for better performance, you will probably need to adjust brake balance to maximize brake performance. By controlling the relative distribution of hydraulic pressure between the front and rear brakes, brake balance affects which tires lock up first under heavy braking. This in turn affects braking distance and understeer/oversteer balance while braking. Adjusting brake balance rearward increases oversteer under braking at the expense of stability. Adjusting brake balance forward increases understeer and improves stability, but it can also lead to excessive understeer when braking. Avoid extremes as they can increase braking distance, and your lap times.","","[Bold:ODBLOKOWANIE PO ZAMONTOWANIU WYŚCIGOWYCH ULEPSZEŃ HAMULCÓW.]<lf><lf>Przyczepność opon w samochodzie i sposób, w jaki następuje przeniesienie masy podczas przyspieszania i zwalniania, decydują o równowadze hamowania. Podczas ulepszania i tuningowania samochodu w celu zwiększenia jego osiągów prawdopodobnie konieczne będzie dostosowanie równowagi hamowania w celu uzyskania optymalnej siły hamowania. Regulując względną dystrybucję ciśnienia hydraulicznego pomiędzy przednimi i tylnymi hamulcami, równowaga hamowania decyduje o tym, które opony blokują się jako pierwsze podczas nagłego hamowania. To z kolei decyduje o długości drogi hamowania oraz równowadze pomiędzy podsterownością i nadsterownością. Przesunięcie równowagi hamowania w tył zwiększa nadsterowność podczas hamowania kosztem stabilności. Przesunięcie równowagi hamowania w przód zwiększa podsterowność oraz stabilność, ale może być przyczyną znacznej podsterowności podczas hamowania. Zbyt wysokie lub zbyt niskie wartości mogą wydłużyć drogę hamowania, a więc i czas okrążenia."
"36252","[Bold:UNLOCKED BY INSTALLING RACE BRAKE UPGRADES.]<lf><lf>Adjust overall brake pressure so the tires will lock under hard braking, but won’t lock prematurely with just a small amount of pedal travel. Reducing total brake pressure increases the amount of pedal travel required to lock the tires. If you reduce it too much, the tires won’t lock at all. Increase total brake pressure if the tires are not locking under hard braking, but don’t overdo it or the tires will lock too easily and send the car out of control.","","[Bold:ODBLOKOWANIE PO ZAMONTOWANIU WYŚCIGOWYCH ULEPSZEŃ HAMULCÓW.]<lf><lf>Ogólną wartość ciśnienia hamowania należy wyregulować tak, żeby opony blokowały się podczas nagłego naciśnięcia hamulca, a nie w przypadku delikatnego ruchu pedału. Ograniczenie całkowitego ciśnienia hamowania zwiększa siłę nacisku potrzebną do zablokowania opon. Przy zbyt dużym ograniczeniu opony nie będą blokować się w ogóle. Zwiększ całkowite ciśnienie hamowania, jeśli opony nie blokują się podczas nagłego hamowania. Jeśli jednak ciśnienie będzie zbyt duże, opony będą blokować się zbyt łatwo, co utrudni kierowanie samochodem."

"36255","[Bold:UNLOCKED BY INSTALLING RACE SPRING AND DAMPER UPGRADES.]<lf><lf>Tuning your car’s damping improves handling by increasing grip. Stiffening front damping adds grip at the rear. Damping controls the suspension’s rate of travel in two directions. Bump damping controls the rate of compression as the suspension goes up into the wheel wells.

Positive camber (with the tops of the tires leaning outward) reduces oversteer, but can make the car unstable. Start with about 0.5 degree of negative camber on each side so the front or rear tires lean inward equally, and then start tuning to get the best results.

"36329","You can’t transmit your car’s power and handling potential to the road without the right tire setup because tire pressure affects a tire’s peak grip, responsiveness, and wear. Adjust front tire pressure when the tires are cold so they reach peak grip once they have heated up to race temperatures. Setting tire pressure lower causes the tires to heat faster, but it can reduce overall responsiveness. Setting tire pressure higher can increase speed and responsiveness, but it makes the tires more prone to sudden loss of grip. Having the front tires closer to peak grip than the rear tires increases the car’s ability to turn in, but it can also cause excessive oversteer if the difference is too great. Experiment by tuning pressure in small increments, because one to two psi (pounds per square inch) can make a big difference.","","Nie można wykorzystać mocy samochodu ani jego sterowności bez odpowiedniego zestawu opon, ponieważ ciśnienie w oponach decyduje o ich maksymalnej przyczepności, reaktywności i zużywalności. Ciśnienie w oponach należy dostosować, gdy są zimne. Dzięki temu rozgrzane podczas wyścigu uzyskają maksymalną przyczepność. Niższe ciśnienie powoduje, że opony szybciej się nagrzewają, jednak może się przyczynić do obniżenia ich reaktywności. Wyższe ciśnienie może spowodować zwiększenie prędkości i reaktywności, ale sprawia, że opony są bardziej narażone na nagłą utratę przyczepności. Uzyskanie wyższej przyczepności w przednich oponach w porównaniu z tylnymi zwiększa zwrotność samochodu na zakrętach, jednak - jeśli różnica jest zbyt duża - może też powodować zbyt ostre pokonywanie zakrętów. Eksperymentuj, dostosowując ciśnienie skokowo, ponieważ jedna czy dwie jednostki psi (funty na cal kwadratowy) mogą zauważalnie zmienić parametry."
"36330","You can’t transmit your car’s power and handling potential to the road without the right tire setup because tire pressure affects a tire’s peak grip, responsiveness, and wear. Adjust cold tire pressure, and then start tuning by setting tires pressures to get maximum grip at race temperatures. In most cases, you will use the same pressure in both front tires and a different pressure in both rear tires to set a balance between understeer and oversteer. Increasing rear tire pressure sharpens steering response by reducing oversteer. This can reduce grip slightly so your tires feel more responsive to steering inputs, but it is less forgiving (loss of grip is more sudden). Decreasing rear pressure and grip slows transitional response by reducing understeer. This can also reduce grip so your tires feel less responsive, but the loss of grip is more progressive. Experiment by tuning pressure in small increments because one to two psi (pounds per square inch) make a big difference.","","Nie można wykorzystać mocy samochodu ani jego sterowności bez odpowiedniego zestawu opon, ponieważ ciśnienie w oponach decyduje o ich maksymalnej przyczepności, reaktywności i zużywalności. Wyreguluj ciśnienie w zimnej oponie, a następnie rozpocznij tuning, ustawiając maksymalną przyczepność przy temperaturze, jaką mają opony podczas wyścigu. W większości przypadków należy zastosować takie samo ciśnienie w obu oponach przednich i inne w oponach tylnych, żeby uzyskać równowagę pomiędzy podsterownością i nadsterownością. Zwiększenie ciśnienia w oponach tylnych powoduje skrócenie czasu reakcji samochodu poprzez redukcję nadsterowności. Może to nieznacznie zredukować przyczepność - wtedy opony wydają się szybciej reagować na działania kierowcy, jednak łatwiej jest popełnić błąd (utrata przyczepności jest gwałtowniejsza). Zmniejszenie ciśnienia i przyczepności w oponach tylnych spowalnia przejściową reakcję poprzez redukcję podsterowności. Może to też nieco zredukować przyczepność, więc reakcja opon może się wydawać wolniejsza, jednak utrata przyczepności jest bardziej rozłożona w czasie.

"37624","You can swap in a new engine to get more power and possibly reduced weight, but every engine has its own upgrade path. Any upgrades on your current engine will not apply to the new engine. As a result, your car’s power may actually decrease with an engine swap. Even with a new, more powerful engine, you may not win races. Winning performance calls for a balance between power and handling. An engine swap also makes an audible difference.","","Wymiana silnika nada samochodowi więcej mocy i potencjalnie zmniejszy jego masę, ale dla każdego silnika istnieje osobna ścieżka ulepszeń. Niektóre ulepszenia obecnego silnika nie zostaną przeniesione do nowego, dlatego zamiana silnika może spowodować obniżenie mocy samochodu. Nawet mając nowy, mocniejszy silnik, możesz nie wygrywać wyścigów. Konieczne jest uzyskanie równowagi pomiędzy mocą silnika i sterownością samochodu. Wymiana silnika powoduje też zmianę dźwięku wydawanego przez pojazd."
"37625","A supercharger is an air pump driven by a belt connected to the engine’s crankshaft. It provides a major power increase by compressing the air-fuel mixture and forcing it into the engine at more than atmospheric pressure. The result is more energy per stroke, which makes more power. These upgrades also make an audible difference. Positive-displacement superchargers produce low boost across the RPM range and a noticeable improvement in low-end and mid-range torque. While positive-displacement superchargers produce boost more evenly than centrifugal superchargers, they are less efficient.","","Sprężarka odśrodkowa to pompa powietrza napędzana przez wał korbowy za pomocą paska klinowego. Zapewnia ona wzrost mocy, tłocząc mieszankę powietrzno-paliwową do silnika pod ciśnieniem wyższym od atmosferycznego. Dzięki zwiększonej ilości powietrza silnik może spalać więcej paliwa, co powoduje wzrost mocy. Sprężarki wyporowe zapewniają niewielkie doładowanie w szerokim zakresie obrotów oraz znaczącą poprawę momentu obrotowego w niskim i średnim zakresie. Działają lepiej, ale są mniej wydajne od sprężarek odśrodkowych."
"37626","An intercooler is a small radiator that cools the hot air from a turbocharger or supercharger before it is forced into the engine. This makes the air-fuel mixture cooler, and therefore more dense, packing more energy per stroke.","","Intercooler to mała chłodnica, która chłodzi gorące powietrze pompowane przez kompresor bądź turbosprężarkę, zanim zostanie ono wtłoczone do silnika. Niższa temperatura powietrza oznacza jego większą gęstość, dzięki której można spalić więcej paliwa i uzyskać więcej mocy."
"37627","Brakes are an important part of the total performance picture. To be competitive, your car’s brake performance must match its power and handling. Leading the pack at the end of a straight won’t help if you can’t slow down fast enough to make the next turn. These upgrades increase braking power and decrease brake fade due to excessive heat.","","Hamulce mają olbrzymie znaczenie dla osiągów pojazdu. Aby można było zwiększyć szanse na zwycięstwo, skuteczność hamowania musi być adekwatna do mocy samochodu i jego właściwości jezdnych. Jazda na czele nic nie da, jeśli nie możesz wystarczająco szybko wyhamować przed następnym zakrętem. Te modyfikacje zwiększają siłę hamowania i zmniejszają efekt utraty jego skuteczności pod wpływem wysokiej temperatury."
"37628","Springs and dampers can make a big difference in your car’s handling by maintaining optimum ride height and tire contact.","","Ulepszenia resorów i amortyzatorów ułatwiają prowadzenie samochodu poprzez utrzymanie optymalnej wysokości pojazdu oraz kontaktu opon z podłożem."
"37629","Front antiroll bars (also called antisway bars) provide extra stability when cornering. When you turn left or right, the car body tends to roll in the opposite direction. By tying the left and right sides of the suspension together, antisway bars make the car ride more level and keep one side from rolling or swaying more than the other.","","Przednie stabilizatory poprzeczne (drążki stabilizujące) zwiększają stabilność podczas pokonywania zakrętów. Podczas skrętów karoseria przechyla się w przeciwnym kierunku. Drążki stabilizujące, które łączą lewą i prawą stronę zawieszenia, odpowiadają za wyrównanie samochodu podczas jazdy, uniemożliwiając jego przechylanie się na jedną stronę."
"37630","The transmission transmits your car’s power from the engine to the drive wheels. Transmission upgrades can make shifts quicker and more efficient, reduce friction and power loss, and provide better durability. These upgrades also make an audible difference.","","Skrzynia biegów przenosi moc samochodu z silnika na koła. Ulepszenia skrzyni biegów umożliwiają szybszą zmianę biegów, redukcję tarcia i utraty mocy, a także zwiększenie trwałości. Te ulepszenia zmieniają też jej dźwięk."
"37631","The clutch is the vital link between the engine and the transmission. Upgrades increase the clutch’s ability to handle the extra torque of a racing engine without damage.","","Sprzęgło to kluczowe połączenie silnika ze skrzynią biegów. Ulepszenie zwiększa możliwości przetworzenia dodatkowego momentu obrotowego w silniku wyścigowym bez jego uszkodzenia."
"37632","For a stock car, the rotating mass of the flywheel smoothes and steadies the rotation of the driveshaft, but it decreases throttle response and acceleration. Upgrading to a lighter-weight flywheel lets the engine respond to the throttle more quickly and increase RPM faster, providing better acceleration.","","Masa obrotowa koła zamachowego stabilizuje obrót silnika, ale powoduje pogorszenie jego reakcji na dodawanie gazu i przyspieszenie samochodu. Instalacja lekkiego koła zamachowego zapewnia lepszą reakcję silnika na dodawanie gazu oraz jego szybsze wkręcanie się na obroty. W rezultacie poprawia się przyspieszenie auta."
"37633","You can improve throttle response and acceleration by decreasing the weight and inertia of driveline components, especially the driveshaft itself.","","Reakcję silnika na dodawanie gazu i przyspieszenie samochodu można polepszyć, zmniejszając masę i bezwładność wału napędowego w ruchu obrotowym."
"37634","The differential allows the tires on each side of the car to turn at different rates because the inside tire travels a shorter distance around a turn than the outside tire. A limited-slip differential locks at a preset point to limit this difference in rotational speed, providing maximum traction under acceleration and/or deceleration.","","Mechanizm różnicowy umożliwia skręcanie kół po obu stronach samochodu pod różnym kątem, ponieważ opona wewnętrzna ma do przebycia krótszą drogę na zakręcie niż zewnętrzna. Mechanizm różnicowy o ograniczonym poślizgu blokuje się we wstępnie zdefiniowanym punkcie, redukując różnicę w zakresie prędkości obrotu. Zapewnia to maksymalną przyczepność podczas przyspieszania i zwalniania."
"37635","Upgraded cams let your engine breathe more freely and rev to a higher RPM, producing more torque and power. The result is a higher redline and more power in the high-RPM range.","","Ulepszone wałki rozrządu umożliwiają swobodniejsze oddychanie silnika oraz osiąganie wyższych prędkości obrotowych i większej mocy. Pozwala to uzyskać wyższą prędkość maksymalną i większą moc w zakresie wysokich prędkości obrotowych."
"37636","A lighter car accelerates and handles better than a heavier one. Reducing weight by removing nonessential materials or replacing stock parts with lighter ones pays off on the track.","","Lżejszy samochód lepiej się prowadzi i lepiej przyspiesza. Redukcja masy przez usunięcie zbędnych części lub ich zamianę na lżejsze odpowiedniki daje rezultaty na torze."
"37637","Upgrading to tires with a softer, more aggressive compound increases traction and improves the tires’ ability to maintain traction despite high heat, but also increases wear. The harder compound used in stock tires sacrifices grip to increase wear. These upgrades also make an audible difference.","","Zamiana opon na bardziej miękkie i przeznaczone do bardziej agresywnej jazdy zwiększa trakcję oraz ułatwia utrzymanie przyczepności pomimo wysokiej temperatury, jednak zwiększa też ich zużycie. Twardsza mieszanka, z której są wykonane opony seryjne w celu zwiększenia ich wytrzymałości, oznacza gorszą przyczepność. Te ulepszenia zmieniają dźwięk słyszalny podczas jazdy."
"37638","Choose larger rims and low-profile tires with shorter, more rigid sidewalls. These tires are less prone to deforming when acceleration and cornering forces increase. This improves traction by maintaining tread contact with the pavement.","","Wybierz większe felgi i niskoprofilowe opony z niższymi, sztywniejszymi ściankami bocznymi. Takie opony są mniej podatne na odkształcenia, gdy rośnie przyspieszenie i siła boczna podczas pokonywania zakrętu. Poprawia to trakcję dzięki utrzymaniu kontaktu opony z nawierzchnią."
"37639","In general, more rubber on the road means better traction and performance. Upgrading to larger, wider tires provides more contact area and thus more traction. You can use wider normal-profile tires to improve traction by enlarging the tire’s contact patch on the pavement. Or you can choose larger rims and low-profile tires with shorter, more rigid sidewalls. These tires are less prone to deforming when acceleration and cornering forces increase. This improves traction by maintaining tread contact with the pavement.","","Ogólna zasada brzmi, że im więcej gumy na drodze, tym lepsze osiągi. Założenie szerszych opon poprawia trakcję, gdyż zwiększa się powierzchnia kontaktu gumy z nawierzchnią. Możesz używać szerszych opon o normalnym profilu, żeby poprawić trakcję dzięki zwiększeniu obszaru styku opony z podłożem. Możesz też wybrać większe felgi i niskoprofilowe opony z mniejszymi, sztywniejszymi ściankami bocznymi. Takie opony są mniej podatne na odkształcenia, gdy rośnie przyspieszenie i siła boczna podczas pokonywania zakrętu. Poprawia to trakcję dzięki utrzymaniu kontaktu opony z nawierzchnią."
"37640","You can upgrade your front bumper to increase the load over the front wheels by increasing downforce. These upgrades allow higher cornering speeds. Note that the Level 3 upgrade makes downforce adjustable.","","Ulepszenia przedniego zderzaka mogą przyczynić do zwiększenia nacisku na przednią oś poprzez wzrost siły docisku aerodynamicznego. Dzięki tym ulepszeniom można pokonywać zakręty z większą prędkością. Ulepszenie 3. poziomu pozwala regulować siłę docisku."
"37641","Upgrading the rear wing on your car increases the load over the rear wheels by generating downforce to allow higher cornering speeds. Note that the Level 3 upgrade makes downforce adjustable.","","Ulepszenia tylnego spojlera zwiększają nacisk na tylną oś poprzez wytworzenie docisku aerodynamicznego, co pozwala na szybsze pokonywanie zakrętów. Ulepszenie 3. poziomu pozwala regulować siłę docisku."
"37642","Rear bumper upgrades improve handling by decreasing lift at high speeds. The Level 3 upgrade also increases the load over the rear wheels by adding adjustable downforce. These changes allow higher cornering speeds.","","Ulepszenia tylnego zderzaka poprawiają właściwości jezdne dzięki zmniejszeniu siły nośnej przy dużych prędkościach. Ulepszenie poziomu 3. zwiększa też nacisk na tylną oś przez dodanie regulowanej siły docisku. Te zmiany pozwalają na szybsze pokonywanie zakrętów."
"37643","Adding modified side skirts reduces weight and drag to improve overall performance.","","Zmodyfikowane progi zmniejszają masę i opór aerodynamiczny, co przekłada się na poprawę ogólnych osiągów."
"37644","Upgrading to a lighter-weight hood reduces overall weight and balance to improve performance.","","Ulepszenie polegające na zmniejszeniu masy maski zredukuje ogólną masę samochodu. Pozwala też regulować rozkład masy, zapewniając lepsze osiągi."
"37645","Displacement upgrades make the engine more durable and less damage-prone. They can also reduce friction/inertia and increase displacement/compression to make the engine more powerful and responsive.","","Ulepszenia pojemności silnika zwiększają jego wytrzymałość. Mogą też zmniejszać tarcie i bezwładność oraz poprawić moc i szybkość reakcji silnika."
"37646","Upgrading rims can improve handling by decreasing the wheels’ unsprung weight and rotational inertia. This upgrade can also enhance performance by decreasing the overall weight of the car.","","Ulepszenie felg może poprawić sterowność samochodu, zmniejszając masę nieresorowaną i bezwładność w ruchu obrotowym. To ulepszenie może też poprawić osiągi dzięki zmniejszeniu całkowitej masy samochodu."
"37647","You can swap an entirely new drivetrain into your car to get different driving characteristics and possibly reduced weight, but every drivetrain has its own upgrade path. Any upgrades on your current drivetrain will not apply to the new drivetrain. As a result, your car’s handling may actually decrease with a drivetrain swap. Even with an upgraded drivetrain, you may not win races. Winning performance calls for a balance between power and handling.","","Wymiana układu napędowego nada samochodowi nową charakterystykę jazdy i potencjalnie zmniejszy jego masę, ale do każdego układu napędowego istnieje osobna ścieżka modyfikacji. Modyfikacje obecnego układu napędowego nie zostaną przeniesione do nowego. Dlatego wymiana układu napędowego może spowodować obniżenie osiągów. Nawet ulepszenie napędu nie gwarantuje zwycięstwa w wyścigach. Konieczne jest uzyskanie równowagi pomiędzy mocą silnika i sterownością samochodu."
"37648","You can significantly alter your car’s body work and stance for a bold new look, different driving characteristics, and possibly reduced weight. Some upgrades on your car’s current body will not apply to the new body kit. As a result, your car’s handling may actually decrease. Even with a body kit, you may not win races. Winning performance calls for a balance between power and handling.","","Modyfikacja karoserii i pochylenia nadwozia nada twojemu samochodowi zadziorny wygląd, zmieni charakterystykę prowadzenia i ewentualnie zmniejszy masę auta. Niektóre ulepszenia karoserii nie zostaną zastosowane w nowych akcesoriach tuningowych. Może to być przyczyną zmniejszenia sterowności samochodu. Nowe akcesoria tuningowe nie gwarantują wygranej w wyścigach. Konieczne jest uzyskanie równowagi pomiędzy mocą silnika i sterownością samochodu."
"37649","Fuel system upgrades can yield big power increases. They provide more efficient fuel flow, more precise timing, the ability to use higher-octane fuel, and they extract more power from the fuel you use. These changes can be as simple as installing a custom Engine Control Unit (ECU) chip or as complex as changing the fuel pump and tank, injectors, and fuel hoses.","","Ulepszenie układu paliwowego może znacznie zwiększyć moc silnika. Usprawnia przepływ paliwa, zwiększa precyzję kontroli czasowej, pozwala używać wysokooktanowego paliwa i umożliwia uzyskanie większej mocy. Zmiany mogą być drobne, np. instalacja zmodyfikowanego chipa ECU, albo skomplikowane, np. wymiana pompy paliwowej wraz ze zbiornikiem, wtryskiwaczy i przewodów paliwowych."
"37650","Improves torque. Available only on naturally aspirated engines.","","Zwiększa moment obrotowy. Dostępne tylko w silnikach wolnossących."
"37651","Remove the stock restrictor plate. Improves torque. Only for race cars.","","Usunięcie oryginalnej płytki ograniczającej. Zwiększa moment obrotowy. Tylko dla samochodów wyścigowych."

"37657","Ignition upgrades help the engine burn fuel more efficiently to produce more power. Adding better coils, spark plugs, and ignition wiring can make a significant difference in engine power and car performance.","","Dzięki ulepszeniom układu zapłonowego silnik efektywniej spala paliwo, co pozwala uzyskać więcej mocy. Dodanie lepszych świec i cewek zapłonowych oraz przewodów wysokiego napięcia może znacznie poprawić moc silnika i osiągi samochodu."
"37658","Adding oil cooling keeps the engine’s oil at the correct temperature, aiding efficiency and increasing power.","","Zamontowanie chłodzenia oleju pozwala utrzymać odpowiednią temperaturę oleju silnikowego, co zwiększa jego moc i wydajność."
"37659","A turbocharger provides a major power increase by using exhaust gases to spin a turbine that compresses the air-fuel mixture and forces it into the engine at more than atmospheric pressure. The result is more energy per stroke, which makes more power. These upgrades also make an audible difference. Two are usually better!","","Turbosprężarka znacznie zwiększa moc poprzez wykorzystanie gazów wydechowych do napędzania turbiny, która dokonuje sprężenia mieszanki paliwa i powietrza oraz kieruje je do silnika pod ciśnieniem wyższym od atmosferycznego. W rezultacie każdy cykl wyzwala więcej energii, a to zwiększa moc silnika. Te ulepszenia zmieniają też jego dźwięk. Zwykle lepiej jest zamontować dwie turbosprężarki."
"37660","Rear antiroll bars (also called antisway bars) provide extra stability when cornering. When you turn left or right the car body tends to roll in the opposite direction. By tying the left and right sides of the suspension together, antisway bars make the car ride more level, keeping one side from rolling or swaying more than the other.","","Tylne stabilizatory poprzeczne (drążki stabilizujące) zwiększają stabilność podczas pokonywania zakrętów. Podczas skrętów karoseria przechyla się w przeciwnym kierunku. Drążki stabilizujące, które łączą lewą i prawą stronę zawieszenia, odpowiadają za wyrównanie samochodu podczas jazdy, uniemożliwiając jego przechylanie się na jedną stronę."
"37661","Chassis reinforcements stiffen the shell of the car, reducing flex when cornering, which in turn aid the suspension in keeping the maximum amount of tire on the road.","","Wzmocnienie podwozia usztywnia bryłę samochodu, co zmniejsza przechyły podczas pokonywania zakrętów, a to z kolei pomaga zawieszeniu zachować maksymalną przyczepność opon."
"37662","In general, more rubber on the road means better traction and performance. Upgrading to larger, wider tires provides more contact area and thus more traction. You can use wider normal-profile tires to improve traction by enlarging the tire’s contact patch on the pavement. Or you can choose larger rims and low-profile tires with shorter, more rigid sidewalls. These tires are less prone to deforming when acceleration and cornering forces increase. This improves traction by maintaining tread contact with the pavement.","","Ogólna zasada brzmi, że im więcej gumy na drodze, tym lepsze osiągi. Założenie szerszych opon poprawia trakcję, gdyż zwiększa się powierzchnia kontaktu gumy z nawierzchnią. Możesz używać szerszych opon o normalnym profilu, żeby poprawić trakcję dzięki zwiększeniu obszaru styku opony z podłożem. Możesz też wybrać większe felgi i niskoprofilowe opony z mniejszymi, sztywniejszymi ściankami bocznymi. Takie opony są mniej podatne na odkształcenia, gdy rośnie przyspieszenie i siła boczna podczas pokonywania zakrętu. Poprawia to trakcję dzięki utrzymaniu kontaktu opony z nawierzchnią."
"37663","Choose larger rims and low-profile tires with shorter, more rigid sidewalls. These tires are less prone to deforming when acceleration and cornering forces increase.

Takie opony są mniej podatne na odkształcenia, gdy rośnie przyspieszenie i siła boczna podczas pokonywania zakrętu. Poprawia to trakcję dzięki utrzymaniu kontaktu opony z nawierzchnią."
"37664","Change how air flows into your car’s engine. Naturally aspirated engines pull in air unassisted, while a turbo or supercharger can compress the air before it reaches the cylinder to extract more performance from an engine.","","Zmień przepływ powietrza przez silnik twojego samochodu. Silniki z naturalnym układem chłodzenia zasysają powietrze bez dodatkowej pomocy, a turbo oraz sprężarka mogą sprężać powietrze, zanim dotrze ono do cylindra, co zwiększa osiągi silnika."
"37665","High-voltage battery packs and generators transmit power to electric motors and drive wheels. Battery and motor upgrades increase power output and durability.","","Akumulatory wysokiego napięcia i generatory przesyłają energię do silników elektrycznych i napędzają koła. Ulepszenia akumulatora oraz silnika zwiększają moc i trwałość."
"37666","A wider spacing between the front tires can provide additional stability under lateral G force.","","Większy rozstaw pomiędzy przednimi kołami może poprawić stabilność przy przeciążeniach bocznych."
"37667","Exhaust system upgrades such as improved headers, mufflers, bypasses, and large-bore tubing provide extra power for a relatively low cost. They let the engine exhale more freely and create more power by reducing back pressure and extracting exhaust gases more efficiently. These upgrades also make an audible difference.","","Ulepszenia układu wydechowego, w tym zmodyfikowane kolektory, tłumiki, bajpasy czy rura o dużej średnicy, zapewniają zwiększenie mocy niewielkim kosztem. Umożliwiają swobodniejsze oddychanie silnika, zwiększając moc poprzez zredukowanie ciśnienia zwrotnego i wzrost wydajności wykorzystania gazów wydechowych. Te ulepszenia da się też usłyszeć w dźwięku silnika."
"37668","A wider spacing between the rear tires can provide additional stability under lateral G force.","","Większy rozstaw pomiędzy tylnymi kołami może poprawić stabilność przy przeciążeniach bocznych."
"37669","Intake upgrades help the engine inhale more freely and provide a lot of bang for the buck. Less restrictive air filters and a tuned intake manifold allow more air into the engine, making more power.","","Ulepszone wloty umożliwiają swobodniejsze oddychanie silnika i zwiększają jego moc stosunkowo niewielkim kosztem. Ulepszone filtry powietrza i zmodyfikowany kolektor dolotowy wpuszczają do silnika więcej powietrza, przez co uzyskuje on większą moc."
"37670","A turbocharger provides a major power increase by using exhaust gases to spin a turbine, which compresses the air-fuel mixture and forces it into the engine at more than atmospheric pressure.

W rezultacie każdy cykl wyzwala więcej energii, a to zwiększa moc silnika. Te ulepszenia zmieniają też jego dźwięk."
"37671","A supercharger is an air pump driven by a belt connected to the engine’s crankshaft. It provides a major power increase by compressing the air-fuel mixture and forcing it into the engine at more than atmospheric pressure. The result is more energy per stroke, which makes more power. These upgrades also make an audible difference. A centrifugal supercharger forces induction with an impeller fan, similar to a turbocharger. Centrifugal superchargers build boost in proportion to RPM and noticeably improve top-end power. While centrifugal superchargers produce boost more efficiently than positive-displacement superchargers, all of that power is concentrated at the top of the RPM band.","","Sprężarka odśrodkowa to pompa powietrza napędzana przez wał korbowy za pomocą paska klinowego. Zapewnia ona wzrost mocy, tłocząc mieszankę powietrzno-paliwową do silnika pod ciśnieniem wyższym od atmosferycznego. Dzięki zwiększonej ilości powietrza silnik może spalać więcej paliwa, co powoduje wzrost mocy. Te ulepszenia można usłyszeć w dźwięku pracującego silnika. Sprężarka odśrodkowa wymusza indukcję z wiatrakiem wirnika, podobnie jak w turbosprężarce. Sprężarki odśrodkowe zwiększają ciśnienie doładowania proporcjonalnie do obrotów, co znacząco poprawia moc maksymalną. Sprężarki odśrodkowe wytwarzają doładowanie wydajniej od sprężarek wyporowych, a cała ta moc jest dostępna w zakresie najwyższych prędkości obrotowych."
